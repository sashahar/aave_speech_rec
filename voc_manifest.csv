data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_12.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_12.txt,right there and across the street was little Girard duh Little Girard Ford Motor Company. Small town then,8.429
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_13.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_13.txt,I would say that that we at that time oh when I when I first was born in nineteen thirty-two uh I would say our population was maybe three thousand four thousand people and uh and then uh when the dam was built why then our population started to,20.364
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_14.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_14.txt,grow. And the [inaudible] that started building the the dam in nineteen thirty-eight. And of course it was completed um five four or five years later. Keep from I I kee- always keep thinking it's from the flooding that they built the dam so that it wouldn't flood. Cuz what uh every year practically why,21.294
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_15.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_15.txt,duh later on I'll get a couple pictures for ya and show ya where the Cyprus Street uh Br- uh uh uh actually the Free F- Free Bridge,10.674
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_16.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_16.txt,washed out from the flood. This was just as the dam was being built. And then in uh south Redding the uh Miracle Mile Bridge it washed out,12.451
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_17.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_17.txt,And the reason they built that was because they're afraid that the Diesil Horse Bridge was gonna be was gonna be old and crumbled. Well today it's still there. St- [laughter] That's like Pine Street School. They said Pine Street School they had to build a new school because of earthquakes and yet it's still standing and there's lots of,21.659
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_18.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_18.txt,But uh Uh It was uh it the dam was was over on Cyprus Street and then uh uh South Market and then in uh Miracle Mile that was the bridge and a railroad bridge washed out. So the only way you could get across and go to north,21.602
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_19.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_19.txt,You know with the lake and all uh course lots of older people moved from the Bay Area and Los Angeles area. They come up. We don't have a lot of I don't believe a lot of middle class uh because there's no There's nothing here t- for them. There's no money.,20.852
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_20.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_20.txt,To make them want to live here after they graduate just like our kids. They graduate from college here and they move away because there's nothing here to uh keep them here.,10.274
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_21.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_21.txt,Uh unless it's in some kind of a industry that they want to stay here they get into like a medical field uh maybe a- an a lumber. It's going out. Uh We have more of a retirement now. I I believe,17.95
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_22.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_22.txt,Yeah.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_37.txt,uh Sequoia School Middle School and they're lots of grammar schools are in when um my kids started. One of my daughters went to Happy Valley. Uh she graduated from West Valley which is one of the finest high schools I believe there is.,15.539
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_38.txt,And Shasta County it's Rush Valley Shasta High is course always my favorite cuz that's where I was from but as far as my daughter liked she just loved West Valley. And it the teachers there were good and they're great. uh I have a grandson that goes to Sycamore right now. And the the teachers there are just fantastic. They just,23.925
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_39.txt,they I just think that hall all the schools are are good.,5.746
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_40.txt,Some are better than others but I believe the teachers really try hard. They don't get a lot of pay but they like it here. Uh there's things to do for that type of a f- a family. They can go on the lake and they can fish and they can swim and Uh We've got the mountains. They can snow ski and,20.514
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_41.txt,Uh But there's not the economy. It's but I think it might be that way you know all over.,8.278
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_42.txt,No. No. We [laughter] we lived up on Eureka Way. And uh you have to look at that. It's right across the street from the high school.,11.715
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_43.txt,And I would listen to the del- bell ring and by the third time that the bell would. We had bells that rang to tell you when to get into your class. Well by the they gave you three rings three bells.,12.673
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_44.txt,And my would not allow my mom to wash them. In fact none of the kids would allow their parents to wash their clothes.,7.456
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_45.txt,Walnut Street. The next street that would be built was Almond. and uh the Eureka Way was just a two-way a two-way street. The high school still looks the same.,13.598
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_46.txt,There's nothing different about the high school. The gymnasium is still there I the everything is is,7.362
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_47.txt,Uh but Walnut Street was the last s- street. and up on a hill was two reservoirs and that was where we got our water from the river,11.856
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_48.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_48.txt,And it would come down uh into Redding and go from there And there was a little creek called Jenny Creek,7.143
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_49.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_49.txt,uh that goes from n- now it's everyone I guess knows where Jenny Creek is but when we were kids why that's where went swimming. Was no swimming pools or anything at at that when we were young.,13.697
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_50.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_50.txt,And uh that creek goes into the Seconana River. Well there was a cave. And I still say there's a cave that's still there. but it's in a subdivision,11.161
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_51.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_51.txt,But it's not a big cave. It's only three feet uh bout three feet wide six or eight feet deep. And we used to get I don't whether when you were young but we would get potatoes and throw them into the fire and wait until they just burn up.,17.729
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_52.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_52.txt,up there. There was no There was a few houses but not many.,5.496
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_53.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_53.txt,but there was nothing there when the cave was there. And then Jenny Creek goes right down goes through the tunnel which we called the tunnel of love and then out into the Sacramento River.,11.771
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_54.txt,And uh Diesel Horse Bridge course was the Diesel Horse people the twins. Uh they lived right there at the at the end just as you come across. And they had a great big um corn field. And we used always go down there and steal the corn that we could,18.351
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_55.txt,The Diesel Horse twins they s- uh were born the- you could put them in a cigar box. That is the truth. Two of them in the to a cigar box. That's yeah [laughter].,15.152
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_56.txt,And that's what we were told when we were when we were growing up. But anyway uh they would always chase us and go through the corn fields and everything and we'd jump into the river. And then they wouldn't be able to catch us. And then we'd swim across the river then over to the other side. And we just had so much fun as a kid. But we'd jump off the bridge or dive off the bridge,22.129
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_57.txt,And then when they put the dam in of course then it got cold. But we figured that well that is our playground and we're still gonna play there so we we did. We we still it was so cold but we still swam there because,16.512
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_58.txt,we didn't have a plunge. But in later years they built the swimming pool down there. They built the park And uh Redding just started growing like leaps and bounds it,11.059
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_59.txt,uh it was just I couldn't believe how fast it was it was growing. And it's i- it's still growing to this day but to me I'm gonna let it grow and I'll just go along with the with the trade and uh and have that but there's another old place that uh that we used go and then,20.169
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_60.txt,If you go up on Butte Street which is just off of Eureka Way in the you cut off of Orange and Olive right at the end of Butte Street it stops just dead ends. To this day it still stops. You can't. It's barricaded. Well there's a rock crusher,21.267
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_61.txt,that the ind- cowboys and Indians used to fight there. I know they did. I wasn't alive when it was but that was told that that rock crusher was where they'd come out and brought all that dirt out and that goes cuts in goes all the way around like this and we found Indian arrow,20.768
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_62.txt,We found those when we were when we were childrens seven eight-years-old Again th- this was all in Manzanita. If you can picture that just no houses uh and you're way way out into the country.,16.62
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_63.txt,Your way out in the country. Well this little rock crusher was where they took dirt out to build roads and things like that with but at that time we were told the cowboys and Indians fought there and the Indians that was a threshold for the Indians.,18.806
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_64.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_64.txt,I don't understand why they don't m- I don't understand why they don't put that into a like a museum type and preserve it.,8.183
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_65.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_65.txt,But I went up here about three weeks ago just to see what it was like. And at one time they put a cement foundation in there it looked like to me but it's gone and ruined. There's glass and there's it i- i- i- it's terrible terrible-looking,16.055
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_66.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_66.txt,but I can't understand why they don't didn't preserve it. When you come down to Redding now and you get down uh uh where they uh Ruck well the red banks I call em The red banks is where the bridges are built and all those houses are up on top of the hill.,19.607
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_67.txt,Well down below uh wh- there's a plantation type there's we'd find arrowheads flints there also. We'd play hooky from school and then we'd go done there and that's where we'd go swimming well that was like a sort of a playground and uh they'd have beehives and we'd,21.522
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_68.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_68.txt,And we'd we'd built little mud dobers or bunt huts like this Well if we'd get stung like on our feet or something We'd just go grab the mud and put them on there and it takes the sting.,11.213
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_69.txt,I don't know if people know that or not but but anyway that's what we did. When we were young like that it was we made our fun for us. Not like it is today with kids have so much things,12.494
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_70.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_70.txt,that are given to them um you made your you made your fun. You made your friends. Uh very close.,8.428

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_161.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_161.txt,Five weeks in a row on Friday it snowed. And I we had big snow I am talking three or four feet.,6.692
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_162.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_162.txt,like that we don't have snowstorms like that anymore. Why I don't know but back then we did. Uh we had lots and lots of flooding before the dam came in. Uh after the dam came in we didn't get much uh floods but uh it's still when the dam would let out a lot of water I'd seen the water clear up to Montgomery Ward's,21.43
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_163.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_163.txt,uh door. Seventy-six hundred cubic feet seventy-six hundred cubic feet come out. They don't do that anymore but they used to,10.159
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_164.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_164.txt,on it. But when we were when were uh I would say the population of Redding when I was twenty-five hundred when I was born. Uh when I got through high school it was probably maybe ten thousand if that between eight and ten thousand population,23.707
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_165.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_165.txt,after high school and then when I went into the service for four years then it started growing. Uh and then just leaps and bounds never did think that it'd ever get to fifty thousand and now it's what? A hundred. [laughter],14.352
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_166.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_166.txt,But uh I'm an old-timer and when uh I was in my older younger generations why I would hate to have I'd hate people that come up from Los Angeles and the Bay Area and come up and um think that they owned,21.935
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_167.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_167.txt,Shasta County or Redding and they'd try to run it and I I don't know why I feel that way but it was they they'd were like coming in and then taking things away from me or taking things away from our city and uh run it their way.,21.281
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_168.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_168.txt,I I guess after uh a few other people from down in the Bay Area and the Los Angeles areas came up here and started promoting Redding uh bringing their friends. And they all started just coming up. And then they got in to our government. And started doing their things their way uh.,21.319
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_169.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_169.txt,And all of the older people that was here they just you know they got old and they put them out and then the younger generations they'd come up they just started they they just started the town and the city. I it's like downtown Redding when,20.472
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_170.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_170.txt,"when they came up here and they said that they were going to put a mall in the downtown Redding I was in business then and I says ""It will never work. You don't want to do that. Don't take don't take the downtown."" Well if you wanted progress this is what we have to do so there was enough of them that can convince you that one person",21.513
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_171.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_171.txt,two persons couldn't you know if if you get a whole bunch of people together they're going to get what they want so that's what they did. They built this mall downtown. And it never did work,13.762
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_172.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_172.txt,I know. I know you don't. And never have but before then you could be able to to walk down that street all of these [inaudible] you had Etten's Drug Store you had Payless you had [inaudible] everything on the right and then hardware's and then Jeramone's and Thompson's and everything like that. You could go down there at night and shop and go from one place to the other.,23.626
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_173.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_173.txt,We only had swamp cores. They didn't have air conditioners then. You could go down one side of the street and come over and come down the other side of the street and go to all of these stores. and shop without somebody shooting you in the,12.777
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_174.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_174.txt,That was back in the oldin days. Then as it grew old got bigger then they put that mall in down there. At first it was they had uh The stores that were already there they put the roof over them and remodeled the front and those people tried to make the business,21.482
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_175.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_175.txt,and it just never worked. Just did never work. Then then they built the Shasta Mall,8.156
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_176.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_176.txt,out where the red banks are. They built that out there. That then took everything away from the mall that was here. They went to Mount Shasta Mall and that's where then all of enterprise grew. Enterprise was nothing,15.909
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_177.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_177.txt,uh never was until Mount Shasta Mall was built. Then people started moving everything out that way uh and Redding then became smaller the town smaller and smaller Enterprise and that area started growing and growing and growing and it still to this day is growing. I still feel in my own personal thing that,22.591
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_178.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_178.txt,building the Oasis Shopping Mall out north of town now it's not Redding Redding is not ready for that right yet. A- neither is the mall and south of Redding Nighten Road it's not ready to be uh for people yet. But if they do do it,22.664
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_179.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_179.txt,yes they're going to get a lot of more people from the Bay Area that's going to move up here cuz that's where the business is that's you know where the net tree is?,10.104
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_180.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_180.txt,Well that area down there I used to I always used to fly and I would fly down to the nut tree at the landing field every Sunday and take my family there. Well it's on the it's on the way to San Francisco right on the freeway you have to go by it but there's nothing but a mall there now.,20.547
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_181.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_181.txt,And all of these other little places the restaurants and everything like that all c- try to cap on but now their doing nothing. So they've had to remodel it. And when they remodeled it then you don't even know that it was a nut tree there anymore. They've got orange trees nut trees magnolia trees. Everything they've tried to copy,21.453
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_182.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_182.txt,those people down there. Uh it's a mall. I I don't like malls. [laughter] I don't.,6.932
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_183.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_183.txt,Uh Redding was Redding was very good very prosperous g- uh city in the sixties. Uh Why uh I don't know but that was the good years.,15.642
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_184.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_184.txt,And uh then in the I would say in the late sixties early seventies uh the malls started to be coming in that's when they s- that's when I feel like those people started coming up from the Bay Area uh or from Los Angeles,21.646
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_185.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_185.txt,Uh i- i- i- i- I just t- I just feel like that I'm not one of those type of people that has to wear a a tie all the time c- c- I will wear a tie on occasions uh but I to be a stock market person uh I'm not that type.,20.823
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_186.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_186.txt,And uh And there's a lot of good there's a lot of good people I know who did that are like that but I'm not,8.426
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_187.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_187.txt,Yeah. They we were good in lumber at that time and so housing was good and so I feel like the people in the Bay Area would let's take for an example [lip smack] let's take a back then let's take a a two hundred thousand dollar home in the Bay Area. It's probably worth a million dollars today.,23.464
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_188.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_188.txt,Let's take two thou- two hundred thousand dollar house they could come up here a two hundred thousand dollar house is fifty thousand,6.684
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_189.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_189.txt,So they could take that two hundred thousand come up here by a fifty thousand dollar house or better and live in the same type of a house that they had down there. So if you could save that much money and then have Shasta Lake all the mountains everything around and the businesses were good and money was here you would want to move. And that's why I feel,23.759
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_190.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_190.txt,today that's what they did. Uh they uh uh It's like the white people coming over from England coming to the United States and putting the Indians out into the reservations it's what they did to us. They put us out into the reservations and they took over the c- took over the city and the town and started running it.,22.146
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_191.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_191.txt,And I feel that way today. There's a lot of old people that have children that have gone and come back uh but the people from the Bay Area that have had children up here they have raised them the way they want and now their in the City Council their in the in the prime things to run Redding.,21.836
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_192.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_192.txt,And uh but that's the way I think probably in every city. that that happens that way. You change you have to change with the ah I'm saying that I'm not saying that I don't want to go with the changes I I just didn't like the way that they went about doing the things that,22.416
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_193.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_193.txt,didn't help the people that are already here. That it was there to help them,6.893
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_194.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_194.txt,Well you know I'd like to they're trying to we have this town has lots and lots of cowboys and we have a rodeo every year. Ever since I was little,20.796
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_195.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_195.txt,growing up. We have a rodeo. It's right downtown. They had a chance the McKong Foundation which is a multi-million dollar uh conglomeration-type people offered to buy and build us our ar- an arena,21.511
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_196.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_196.txt,"south of town. The Gore Ranch was gonna donate the property. McKong Foundation was gonna build it for us. And the city fathers now would not allow that. They said ""No.""",17.509
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_197.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_197.txt,Because they didn't think that it was fine enough for the people. Okay now where are the people gonna go that'll go to the rodeo now? Th- they'll still have it. We still have the rodeo.,11.368
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_198.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_198.txt,We have that convention center right there that can't even make it make a go of it,5.572
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_199.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_199.txt,and yet it's nothing but a piece of brick building they never even modernized it when they first built it. It was just a big big piece of cement when they built it. Uh but our rodeo is right just to the left of thatand it's always been successful.,17.618
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_200.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_200.txt,We have uh ten thousand people ten to twelve thousand every year downtown Market Street comes for pancake breakfast,12.705

What I don't know. Why didn't they that's you asked me a question and I think that's one way that they should do is,20.982
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_204.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_204.txt,instead of putting in a great big I know that they want the the money to come into this this community and how are you going to bring th- people into this community you can't bring them all in at one time and and make money but I think that you have arena that's down there that they want to and that's gonna be nice.,20.5

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_218.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_218.txt,peaches You can't go down in in the Bay Area and find anything like that. Well Churn Creek's about one of the only places left that you can still go and do that. There's a few places out in Jones Valley uh out Oasis Road things like that but it's all just about Oak trees and and,22.691
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_0_part_219.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_0_part_219.txt,dry Churn Creek is good solid loam. Just like you put your you could go down to Churn Creek right now plant a seed into the ground without doing anything. Just put your thumb and it'll grow. but if they put a mall down there they're going to destroy it.,20.949

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_71.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_71.txt,and so you would see a lot of people dressed up in pretty normal clothes they wouldn't express themselves like the stompers or the goths and buy I was still thankful they were there because they were supporting us and there has been a handful of people ... who now this is the only type of music that they listen to and it's really cool and they they enjoy expressing themselves,21.176
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_72.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_72.txt,like this now ... so as time has gone on ... you see that the people from the two different sides of the music spectrum ... they're slowly beginning to be in our pictures now that we take and so that's cool and Analogist was one of our best clubs ever,20.603
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_73.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_73.txt,because I felt like finally we have the goths here and we have the s- the the the rivet heads and the stompers in the same it was great so the way that the crowd has changed is of course by numbers it's gotten bigger but the people who I believe would like it ...,21.003
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_74.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_74.txt,they've they've started showing up more often ... so I believe it's becoming more of a scene now and it's because of them they've decided to lay their money down and come give it a chance and I'm thankful for it and so they've been great they've been cool like we had God Module ...,20.709
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_75.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_75.txt,and there are so many people who I thought should've been there for God Module but they weren't oh well that's okay maybe next time because we didn't quite know them yet or they did not know about us yet then we had Burning Image uh there was a lot of punks and goths who came to Burning Image that I can say they they came out to support their band,21.528
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_76.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_76.txt,and so that was great ... so that's the way that the crowd has changed you'll see more goths and more stompers and rivet heads in the pictures and that's cool,11.31
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_77.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_77.txt,yes you're right ... at first it seemed like that was going to be something that we were going to deal with ... but it doesn't uh if it is going on I don't know about it and I suppose I would rather not know about it if it is going on I don't know about it because there's a lot of goth people ... who come and support and they like it,20.046
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_78.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_78.txt,and they're being way cool about it so no I have not noticed any ... politics or cliques to where they talk about ba- about the other genre scene at Heresy ... I have or elitism I haven't noticed any of that people have been way cool about it,21.316
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_79.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_79.txt,and I'm real thankful about it cuz it's less I have to deal with you know and and my vision is actually forming ... so no I haven't no drama nothing like that ... just everyone coming together having a good time it seems ... maybe it's so far maybe it's a little,20.283
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_80.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_80.txt,too good you know that that there's not been a whole lot I've had to deal with with people being ec- exclusive or anything so no not really,9.287
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_81.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_81.txt,it is cool it is my wife and I were just talking about something along these lines coming back from the Covenant show yesterday ... I think in a scene like ours in the goth and and industrial scene we love our music we love the self-expression the way people dress,20.48
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_82.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_82.txt,we love it it's not mainstream all we have is each other ... and I would like to think if there's any place in Bakersfield where goths or industrial people uh r- rivet heads stompers if there's any place in the world where they're not going to have to deal with nonsense or drama it would be at a place like Heresy ...,21.264
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_83.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_83.txt,if there's any place where you're somebody ... it's gonna be at Heresy once a month ... because all we have is each other we w- our stuff doesn't get put out on the radio waves and people have all kinds of misconception about goths you and I both know this so if there's any place in the world where you're not gonna be putting up with drama it should be at a goth and industrial music event,21.186
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_84.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_84.txt,where you come together and enjoy and celebrate each other's self-expression that's something that I talk a lot with with my if you want to call it staff people who work with me at Heresy we talk a lot about that if we're gonna talk bad about any type of music let's do it privately any kind of styles that we abhor,20.765
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_85.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_85.txt,so no I haven't noticed a lot of the politics ... or elitism or ... exclusive activity that you might find elsewhere I'm sure it's there and I'm sure it may be coming ... but so far I haven't noticed it ...,15.818
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_86.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_86.txt,yes and I've noticed that ... yeah it's been nice and I really want to promote it as such I really do for the same reason dude come in at the bar that we do it in there's two different sections to the bar ... the the the proper you know the bar proper,20.945
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_87.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_87.txt,and then they have an area that is called the backstage it's a place where bands can perform the bar owners they saw it it was storage and the bar owner said we could put bands here and let them perform and they did ... and it's great so on a regular night a lot of people will go from the normal part of the bar into the backstage with no problem,20.122
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_88.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_88.txt,"... well we set up a curtain there because this is where we're having our event and we the- so all night long people are trying to come through and I always tell them ""hey it's a five dollar cover charge""",8.909
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_89.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_89.txt,it's in the backstage only ... so you have many different people on the other side many different people hip hop American top forty all kinds of stuff is over there on the other side it's a bar there's gonna play what is popular of course I would too ... well over on our side it's pure goth or industrial music so people will come through the curtain,20.357
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_90.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_90.txt,"and I'll say ""hey how you doing?"" ""five dollar cover charge"" ""if you're gonna come party with us tonight"" and a lot of time they'll walk in like dude what is going on in here they they can't believe it and when they see the people with the huge you know Jonny Slut death hawk ... or something or some guy with you know cyber goggles th- they they back it up they're out of there",20.344

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_92.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_92.txt,people who have come in from the other side ... have loved it they're not goth or industrial in any way they don't know the difference when s- between Sisters of Mercy or ... whatever electro band you want to say on the right on the r- on the other side they have no idea all they know is that they like it and so,20.24
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_93.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_93.txt,I would like to think that it's a welcoming atmosphere ... one thing that happened and I always watch it I always watch it ... I don't want someone to take this the wrong way ... but there's no other way to say it and when you see it you'll recognize it ... sometimes we come out of the same doors,21.11
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_94.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_94.txt,the sa- excuse me different doors to the same bar you have our crowd and you'll have the other crowd ...,7.151
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_95.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_95.txt,which is in the main bar and they're good people but sometimes people go to a bar to get drunk and that's the only reason sometimes and sometimes there could be problems so sometimes you can see clear separation and I've always told people in other interviews that I've given coming to Heresy is more than just getting drunk in a bar people who are into this type of music,20.822
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_96.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_96.txt,this type of lifestyle this type of self-expression they come there for the experience they don't want to just go to get drunk at Heresy they want to go there for the experience so see you can see a clear difference in the attitude ... between those people and the people who just go to get drunk in a bar because sometimes drama starts,20.144
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_97.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_97.txt,and I'm not s- talking about the bar necessarily that we put this on in where we are at there's ... like three or four different bars right there in the same area ... so you could see a clear difference sometimes ... so I'm trying to build on that in making it a very welcome environment ... sometimes you could see the clear contrast,21.12
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_98.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_98.txt,no there there's never been any conflicts between when I say our group I mean the goth and industrial subculture music group,7.794
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_99.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_99.txt,people who come specifically at Heresy never been any conflicts and I'm thankful for that ... they have gotten a lot of weird looks ... they have some people are uncomfortable with that some people they don't care but there's never been any n- conflict never been any fights nothing like that,20.584
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_100.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_100.txt,well what it does what it is is I have a man who is our resident d-j his name is Thad and he has many many years' experience d-j-ing a lot of the clubs in the goth and industrial scenes in Los Angeles ... and so he comes and he is always the first choice for d-j-ing,20.007
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_101.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_101.txt,... he's the resident d-j ... and I d-j ... so I open ... I open the club I d-j from ten p-m until about eleven fifteen when the band goes on ... and then after the band Thad closes out the night so from eleven fifteen till midnight is usually when the band performs,20.971
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_102.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_102.txt,so midnight to two he takes care of the rest of it and really Thad has a good time to d-j because a lot of people have already gotten plenty of alcohol in them and they're warmed up and they're ready to dance and Thad knows how to play dance music he's good he's really good and I just love watching him do it he has a lot of enthusiasm,21.3
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_103.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_103.txt,and um so yes myself and Thad we he d-js there is two other d-js that we have a d-j called I am Faust his name is Faustino so his d-j name is I am Faust and then uh a friend of mine that my wife and I went to high school with who lives in Los Angeles now her name is uh Flora,21.442
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_104.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_104.txt,so her her initials are f-m so her d-j name is Lady f-m and so she hangs out with uh the l-a dead all the clubs that they put on she goes to Das Bunker Bar Sinister she goes all those clubs and she d-js for us on occasion so when we had God Module I was too busy being the promoter,20.786
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_105.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_105.txt,dealing with the band making sure the band had everything taken care of so I am Faust and DJ That took care of the d-j that night ... and so most of the time I d-j sometimes ... the other two will come and d-j in my place and they do a great job ...,18.6
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_106.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_106.txt,and the reaso- yes and here's the reason why the early set mine is different from the later set because ... d-j Thad knows goth music ... and he knows industrial and e-b-m ... but he loves industrial e-b-m and agro-tech music and very,20.688
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_107.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_107.txt,good at d-j-ing it so he leans very heavy towards that so the difference in the two is because ... I love industrial music ... but I will lean pretty heavy towards the goth and death rock and dark wave part because if I'm advertising it as a goth industrial club,20.287
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_108.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_108.txt,I cannot play pure industrial music ... Thad loves his industrial music so I will d-j first and I will throw more goth in there so if you come early ... you're more likely to hear bands like Burning Image Sisters of Mercy you're more likely to hear Alien Sex Fiend,21.128
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_109.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_109.txt,or Community F-K ... Forty Five Grave ... Thad'll play those bands ... but I tend to play them more often than he does ... then getting more into the dark wave bands you will hear Echo and the Bunnymen or The Church or The Cure or Dapeche Mode you're more likely to hear,20.463
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_110.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_110.txt,those bands if I'm d-j-ing ... and in you're more likely to hear ... Centhron or ... Combichrist ... Nocmar Bluid Angle ... you're more likely to hear those bands ... Cyclone Nine ... any kind of power noise group like,22.406
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_111.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_111.txt,... Bitch per Minute or ... Waste ... or Cerebrum Vortex any kind of power noise industrial e-b-m agro-tech you're more likely to hear that stuff when he plays he loves the goth so that's when you would that's the reason why you would see a little bit of a difference between the g- music genres s- more,21.462
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_112.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_112.txt,very simply because I play a little more goth and dark wave than he does and it works it works really good I like it I enjoy it,8.201
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_113.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_113.txt,people stay people really stay and there's no difference in the crowd but I'm thankful for it ... one the only thing that happens and when I first saw it it really freaked me out we don't have a smoking section ... if you were to go to Heresy you would find out that ... the back door to the bar ...,20.319
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_114.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_114.txt,is an alley ... so the front door to Heresy is the back door of the bar ... just the way we have it set up ... so people go out of the front door to Heresy into the alley to smoke ... so what happens i people will come early they will listen to my set,20.635
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_115.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_115.txt,"they will start drinking the band plays ... they will dance enjoy the band ... and when the band is finished ""think you for having us"" ""good night"" ... Thad starts his d-j set ... and the dance floor is empty ... and it really freaked me out when I first saw it but all it was is people going out to smoke a cigarette and when the song is over",21.148
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_116.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_116.txt,going for the next song they all come back in but there was no difference in the crowd it's the same people and they always stay and they hang out ... it's amazing I'm very thankful for it,9.679
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_117.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_117.txt,no they they do s- they do get there early and for the Burning Image show we had a long line because we had presale tickets ... some of the people who came ... December January February March ... and just walked right in ... when they came to the May show with Burning Image and I'm getting somewhere with this,21.094

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_119.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_119.txt,dancing though and I'm starting to notice this I'll play the music and I'll when I get my d-j set .. thought out ... I'll think probably this is about the time that people are gonna start dancing and you know what they don't they're talking and they're getting they're they're drinking and they're getting comfortable ...,20.453
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_120.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_120.txt,they will start dancing about my last five songs ... so they will come they will enjoy it they love listening to the goth music or the dark wave ... but they will start dancing toward the end and so I'm starting to get to a place where I will put goth and dark wave at the beginning and then I'll start getting into,20.966
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_121.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_121.txt,the industrial stuff e-b-m and then I'll kind of finish up with a little bit of goth and dark wave music right before the band so that way by the time they get there they've heard a pretty good variety of music and they're gonna start dancing and they're usually gonna start dancing to something like My Life with the Thrill Kill Cult ... or Sisters of Mercy ...,20.412
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_1_part_122.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_1_part_122.txt,or Alien Sex Fiend ... something like that that way they still ... get some of the goth music dancing in now Thad's gonna play some goth but he's gonna play probably eighty percent e-b-m industrial so they will dance to it they will get there early they just won't get on the dance floor as soon as I would like them to [laughter],19.945

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_9.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_9.txt,mostly just US history  and government and all that  and  I'm very much a debater,7.918
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_10.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_10.txt,a lot and it makes people mad just because a lot of times I play devil's advocate  and oth- th- nobody really knows what I actually believe,9.457
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_11.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_11.txt,yeah um  yeah so it ju- it just makes people mad because I constantly love to argue about this stuff and the trouble is that people they make it always personal where where I as I just like to I just like the debate itself,15.177
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_12.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_12.txt,oh ke- just you know there's all the key issues like the economy the  homosexual marriage the  abortion all that stuff,12.998
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_13.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_13.txt,in a debate I can take either side  but personally  I just I just think that people should  take responsibility for their actions I think that's one of the biggest trouble troubles is that  abortion stems from  people not wanting to take responsibility for their actions,23.149
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_14.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_14.txt, I just wish that people might have more common sense so  so personally I'm against all of it,10.321
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_15.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_15.txt,um  the- they t- a lot of times like people they try to pull the  political correctness card and you're not being politically correct here,10.093
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_16.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_16.txt,oh just like ther- there's the idea  that to be politically correct you can't you have to tolerate other people's beliefs you can't hurt their feelings and all that stuff and I just answer that I mean like I know it sounds like I'm kind of a jerk when I say b-but I don't care  I win,17.541
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_17.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_17.txt,yeah I think toleration in itself is  a very ambiguous term because if you tolerate someone else's beliefs then they won't tolerate yours that's just how it works cuz both sides can't tolerate each other it just won't work that way,16.34
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_18.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_18.txt,if you find them y- yeah there are I mean we are very conservative up here but a lot of people  have different ideas about how that takes form I kn- I know in my class I think  in my class of thirty three students [laughter] there were  thirty one,20.679
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_19.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_19.txt,oh we're always vocal about it yeah and we don't care we're all friends anyway  but  yeah that kind of gives you an idea of what politic- politics are like up here,13.286
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_20.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_20.txt,I'm a conservative libertarian  I think that laws are meant for stupid people who have no common sense and I just think that the world would be safer if everybody if all the stupid people were kind of not here  but,20.282
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_21.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_21.txt,generally I mean of course there are certain things we disagree on but m- for the most part we,6.328
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_22.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_22.txt,not so much I mean politically the only things we disagree on is how to fix the problems as opposed to  what ideas we're against or for,11.39
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_23.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_23.txt,I just  in my opinion th- th- they think we should  like the Tea Party the cut back on funding and all that stuff I think we should reset the government,13.441
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_24.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_24.txt,I have no idea I haven't really given it really in depth thought of like if I were President this is what I would do but  I just think most  political leaders have been in office for too long we just need a fresh start with government  it it's like that Staples commercial press the easy button,20.051
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_25.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_25.txt,I know Redding in it in itself seems to  um  uh  what was the question,17.886
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_26.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_26.txt,uh  definitely because Redding in itself has done a lot of  taxing and spending on beautification projects I mean yeah,13.685
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_27.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_27.txt,like the Sundial Bridge  all that stuff there's there's been a lot of and I think most of this a lot of the infrastructure is state funded projects but there's been a lot of beautification and I do- I don't have a problem with that I mean I think a city should try to be as great as possible I just  think you shouldn't do that at the expense of going into debt,21.45
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_28.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_28.txt,I would I would try to encourage a lot of volunteer programs to do s- things just cleaning volunteering library time community service a lot of that ,9.907
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_29.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_29.txt,generally yeah when I have the time I've done s- things at the Good News Rescue Mission,5.83
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_30.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_30.txt,it's a lot of times I do it with my church I we go there and we lead a worship service and then sometimes we help serve dinner  so  I just  I mean in the world we live in it's never going to be a reality but if everybody was nice to each other but it's not gonna happen  I think,20.912
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_31.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_31.txt, I think people need to be put to work  cuz I know there is definitely some people in welfare who deserve it because of handicaps and the inability to work but I think some people don't try at all  so,16.177
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_32.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_32.txt,I didn't actually grow up in Redding itself I g- grew up in Cottonwood which is about  fifteen miles south  I mean history of Redding Redding was kind of  a mining town that grew into a large populous it's the intersection of fourty four two ninety nine and I-5  um  and then there's were several communities that sprung out around it like Palo Cedro and Anderson and Cottonwood,24.737
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_33.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_33.txt, so Cottonwood in itself isn't actually technically a town it's just a  a zone,6.066
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_34.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_34.txt,it's very rural  very hot very dry  there's a lot of ranches out there  a lot of uh  rednecks out there,10.008
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_35.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_35.txt,uh they've they've  they've been there as long I I've been alive  uh my dad's family grew up in this area my gran- his dad was a uh  captain for the fire department  and then after he retired he became a rancher  my mom's family moved,20.865
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_36.txt,from the Montana area  so  both sides actually came from very rural environments we've we don't really care for the city very much just we like our privacy,13.563
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_37.txt,my dad uh he'd uh he's a project manager for a software company that not exactly sure exactly what they do but  just he'd his uh major is Information Technology and Business Management,14.045
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_38.txt,yeah  and my mom is a housewife so she she's done various jobs like she used to be a nurse's assistant she was at one time I think a secretary  and also does like typing work for people ,20.331
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_39.txt,I raised pigs  I try to keep myself diversified you know theater pigs,5.531
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_40.txt,oh it's really big yeah  um it's gotten smaller with you know the economy and not a lot of people are buying as much at fair and losing support for the fair system and all that um,12.181
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_41.txt,yeah you raise your pi- your animal you go to the fair then there's an auction people bid on your animal  and so it's actually gotten better and worse because you know with just last year I mean the economy picked up a little bit around fair time and so while there are less people less pigs to buy from there are more buyers,20.763
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_42.txt,mhm [yes]  so 4-H is is really cool because being when I was in high school and I did it I could see more of the business side of it the economy and  then also you know the responsibility of having to take care of an animal,13.404
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_43.txt,pretty easy actually I mean  a lot of people get attached to their animals I never really had that problem,6.764
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_44.txt,just the idea that you know you can pick out your schedule times you can leave whenever you want  I mean school is school  in all honesty  so  any changes I they're really miniscule and I don't mind them at all,17.537
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_45.txt,well after after I  I'll probably  g- transfer to a four year university maybe do some time in the military explore the world  possibly I d- after a certain time I'll come back here,13.769
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_46.txt,the traffic  just a lot more g- just w- the idea is that I've said there's a lot of really stupid people in the world and it's it's not to be mean or anything it's just true not not a lot of people have common sense and so even here people aren't good drivers and it's just really annoying,20.958
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_47.txt, and so you take that problem multiply it by a a hundred and that's the city for you then of course me being a conservative that I am generally large urban areas have a more liberal populous so  not a lot of people to I guess uh connect with,20.848
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_48.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_48.txt,there's there's the general stereotypes like Los Angeles has smog  and San Francisco has all the gay people  and  that those are pretty much the two cities that California has so and Sacramento has all the politicians so ,23.497
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_49.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_49.txt,um  I mean some of us are very stereotypical in thinking but it comes from I think a pretty solid basis,9.409
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_50.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_50.txt,I mean  while we stereotype these cities for categories that they are I think that we have good evidence for why we do that,8.256
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_51.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_51.txt,uh well came to the peak in the fourties when they had Jeffersonian movement  and a lot of us I mean it's still not dead a lot of us really wouldn't mind being a separate state,11.281
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_52.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_52.txt,I support it  wholeheartedly just because  we as our Northern population we know what we need for we have our agriculture and our job market which is completely separate and distinct from the city  and all that  and so we don't really appreciate the fact that ,20.763
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_53.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_53.txt,our mi- minority voting support gets overruled by the large population of the cities  so they do what's best for them but it doesn't work for us so we suffer for their decisions,11.571
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_54.txt,yeah  and so it it just uh  it gets really annoying because  we want our political say and we don't get it right right um,13.649
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_55.txt,I mean I I've heard the same thing is happening in like Im- Imperial Valley they want almost want to start a new s- uh state as well cuz they're a very rural and rural environment as well,12.497
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_56.txt,right now it's just talk  but uh I do know that there's a lot of people who  very much advocate it and want it to happen I think if I ever went into politics that would be a big thing for me is I would try to get that to happen,14.42
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_57.txt,yeah the thing is is constitutionally it's almost impossible right now because Southern California relies on all the water we give them and  so they rely on us but we don't really rely on them for much  is besides I mean ,18.173
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_58.txt,I don't know they come from all over I mean a lot of people in the area I mean even people like  I heard Kennedy had a cabin out at Shasta Lake or something like that  a lot of actors and stuff actually have cabins out there and in f- in fact actually in my neighborhood there's a house that was built by Clint Eastwood for his daughter,21.492
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_59.txt, yeah  and I just found that out recently but ,6.514
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_60.txt,yeah it's generally fine I mean  tourism's fine they can enjoy our resources just don't mess with them,11.059
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_61.txt,oh I think well cuz recently with the drought down south I know there's a lot of issues with the water  and then of course with the losing of our water our lakes get lower  and everything starts looking really ugly  but you know people do need water and I understand that I just think that ,20.544
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_62.txt,if we're going to give them such a valuable resource they should give us a little bit more respect and authority with it,6.758
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_63.txt,yeah my dad was his family was raised in the area so,5.206
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_64.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_64.txt,ge- generally about if you look about three generations back that's as long as people have been there and then if you go further they've started coming back from either down south or further east,10.863
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_65.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_65.txt,well just one's a city and one's not  there's a lot more people up here and there there are more  I mean we ha- there's a little bit more of the c- cultural diversity of the people who are like the quote unquote gangsters  the white trash the ,20.594
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_66.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_66.txt,they're they're just more like city slicker type the stereotypical city slicker up here whereas Cottonwood is more of the rancher farmer cowboy redneck type of community,10.2
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_67.txt,I don't think so not really that I've heard of  I mean we have our turf they have theirs it's,9
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_68.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_68.txt,okay uh let's see  probably ,20.887
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_69.txt,here you have Northern California  which is a more conservatives than Central and Southern California which is the more city environment and then the Imperial Valley area,14.864
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_3_part_70.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_3_part_70.txt,I I think the Imperial Valley area and Northern California are more alike politically and socially  whereas the s- separating factor is all the cities in between us,12.777

I mean I'm talking about back in the nineteen fifties you know and it was comparably I guess a lot safer. I mean we never knew that there was trouble outside or anything We were allowed to just run free as kids. You know I don't think I had a -- a mother who didn't care but you know I mean everybody was allowed to be outside,22.245
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_2.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_2.txt,without fear of being abducted or anything. We lived down by the Sacramento River and -- and we'd han gout down there. We'd build forts outside.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_3.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_3.txt,Uh well far fewer people. I mean it seemed like you used to be able to go anywhere and there're no people you know that it -- well it was pretty distinct. I mean there was Sacramento and then there was the north area which was also Sacramento and generally the north area didn't hang out {LG} with the -- the regular Sacramentans and then there was west Sac and,21.586
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_4.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_4.txt,um but it was just -- it was a smaller place really not as a child but I mean in my -- when I got into my teens and twenties seems like I would always see somebody I knew and the freeways weren't there and you know lot of the freeways weren't even in at that point. Wait I feel like I'm old. [LG} Um so it was just -- it was smaller,20.469
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_5.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_5.txt,and it was funny cuz when I knew I was gonna be doing this and I'm thinking about Sacramento I just remember simple things like down where the capital is on Tenth and K you knew it would be like all the cars would stop in all directions and -- and everybody would kitty corner however. You know it'd be -- but now it's like everything is one way this way that way you know and it used to just be a free for all.,21.818
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_6.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_6.txt,Oh God no yeah it's just too many people. I mean and there's you know Sacramento has just grown out become you know all the sub communities that it's just -- it's one big city now and so no I don't know {LG} and I'm sure I didn't know everybody then. It just you know I just don't see people like I used to.,21.459
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_7.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_7.txt,Pretty much so north of the river. Even they would consider like over out on Watt Avenue which is actually east. Are you -- are you local at all or no? I mean we would consider that all north Sa- +Sacramento I guess that would be north of the river too yeah. {LG},14.667
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_8.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_8.txt,Um I don't think so. I mean we just saw it that way you know -- you know oh you're from the north area (()) {LG} we were better -- I don't know what we thought.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_9.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_9.txt,It must've just been a geographic location you know that those of us in Sacramento that fact that we did know each other and that it was a smaller city a much smaller city you know and I guess they -- it just turned out to be that you would go through school together and everything and you would know those people and that would be it.,19.622
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_10.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_10.txt,I found myself just enunciating that word Sacramento you know {LG} I r- +(()) probably just because of where I am right now um what pardon me?,9.717

It would just -- we would go hang out on the levy and actually we swam in the river. I was talking to my brother about that the other day. We'd -- we'd spend a lot of time swimming in the river and now you can't do that. I mean there's boats and personal watercraft and everything else so that's -- that's changed a lot. I guess there are still little,20.935
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_12.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_12.txt,pools and areas where you know kids still hang out in the water but not like -- not like -- not like it used to be . {LG},7.984
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_13.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_13.txt,Oh I don't know I mean I wouldn't say that was the major place I hung out. We -- we moved. Um my family moved several times always within kind of even the same area in Sacramento but moving from house to house and um so when I was by the river we were there and then when we moved like a half a mile away but away from the river,22.556
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_14.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_14.txt,Oh we'd -- we'd build tumbleweed forts and everything and tunnels and all these things that would probably be really dangerous but you know I mean really I remember hanging out with my brother and his friends. He was I guess a big influence on me. He was a couple years older and they'd you know we'd have these underground forts that I'm sure people would not allow their kids to be in now for danger of collapse,22.181
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_15.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_15.txt,you know but we'd cover 'em with tumbleweeds and everything and then there's a part I mean which is a completely developed area right now but it was within walking distance but it was Munger's back then and we'd build rafts -- I guess I was a tomboy -- we'd build -- oh and I remember (()) lizards and then snakes and collecting all these things yep,20.052
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_16.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_16.txt,cuz I mean I see my litle great nephew and neices now and they just (()) just game playing.,8.34

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_18.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_18.txt,you know not the north east south or west although when the -- our house by the river was probably as far south as you could go at that point although it's beyond that now and it was um it even had like a rural route post office. I remember that and you know there was not considered in the city even probably. It's --,22.796
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_19.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_19.txt,you don't know Sacramento though do you? No see? So -- so it's like -- it's probably about a mile south of here. This is Suttervile Road right here. The next exit is Fruitridge if you were going south. That was where we lived just right there but there wasn't anything beyond that so,16.444
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_20.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_20.txt,Oh yeah well Elk Grove it -- it goes into Elk Grove which is a huge developed city now. It's its own city yeah.,9.179
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_21.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_21.txt,Uh well right next door to our house well -- let's see when I started -- see I have to remember when we moved um but right behind our house like over the fence there was a school it was called Sutter Union at the -- at the time and another thing to make old was um it became -- it changed to John Cabrillo which was probably John Cabrillo there we go I'll pronounce it correctly,22.769
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_22.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_22.txt,but everybody pronounces it John Cabrillo and it's changed the name to there but somebody once told me oh I said I went -- it was called Sutter Union and they said oh I saw like a historical plaque in there saying it was Sutter Union. I said yep that's it. That's how far back it was so I went there until -- oh -- I guess I changed schools a few times too,22.346
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_23.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_23.txt,um until fourth grade. No I did kindergarten first grade then my mother sent me to Catholic school so I could get first communion then put me back in there for third and fourth then put me back in Catholic school through eighth grade and then I went to a Catholic high school for two years and it shut down and I went to another Catholic high school for another two years,22.81
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_24.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_24.txt,but from fifth grade on most of the people did you know from my elementary school did that you know with the two years two years here.,9.003

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_26.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_26.txt,Well uh in second grade I probably didn't pay much attention to it you know and my cousins who are ten years older than I am they -- they went to the Catholic high school and they'd had an elementary school and I guess they just figured I would just hop in the car with them and go and we were all neighbors as well as family so I didn't even think about it but by fourth grade I had established friendships and everything and it -- it was very hard,26.277
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_27.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_27.txt,you know but it just by the end of fifth grade or probably well into you know not even too far into fifth grade I was fine you know kids adapt. ,10.238
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_28.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_28.txt,Oh I don't -- I mean {LG} yeah are we talking about through high school? (()) elementary -- it -- it's hard.

I've always just gone to school and when I got outta high school it was like expected it wsan't even talked about that I would go to college and not,20.558
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_29.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_29.txt,because I you know was some really smart person it was just expected you know that that's what happens so I didn't even question that I just went right on through,9.903
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_30.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_30.txt,San Jose State which is where I said there that I was gone. I -- undergrad and grad. I went back to graduate school there too,7.898
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_31.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_31.txt,Oh I liked it. {LG} It was pretty wild times though you know the first time around (()) for years sixty-six to -- sixty-eight to seventy I mean a lot of things happening at that point. {LG} Student protests and you know and S T S and the radicals Yeah so it was -- it was an exciting time.,19.362
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_32.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_32.txt,State but they were kind of you know Berkeley San Jose State everybody there was you know taking up the cause and you know anti war and -- and the whole civil rights thing and this and that and black panthers and so again it was so far back but I remember being part of that and I'll always be glad that I was cuz it was a lot of changes going on,24.525
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_33.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_33.txt,and I like it when I see you know students or whoever now protesting things depending on to what level they go you know I think nonviolent protest is -- is fine is good is the way to get things done.,12.889
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_34.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_34.txt,Just protesting {LG} at you know at schools and street corners or what have you yeah  so I mean it wasn't anything radical radical.,9.637
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_35.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_35.txt,Well it was my first freedom. I mean I came here I was actually in Sacramento City College you know for two years and then I went away after -- after two years and it was Oh my god I don't live at home anymore. It was very exciting you know. Yes there was a lot of pot and everything else {LG} so I don't care put it on record it's so far ago you know but it was just,23.266
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_36.txt,you know the old Catholic upbringing got dropped {LG} you know it was just like oh I don't have to go to mass anymore.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_37.txt,Well the -- there really weren't many programs in library science so it wasn't like I could just you know within they just started -- I mean now they don't even have a brick and mortar building. The whole library science program is online so I was kind of there towards the end of it but Berkeley I think was just phasing their -- Berkeley um,20.526
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_38.txt,San Jose State and U C L A I think were the only three schools in California,7.092

That's -- oh I forgot I lived in Honduras okay for two years so I was in Honduras from nineteen seventy-nine to well I extended six months -- eighty-two yeah forgot all about that {LG} cuz I did the Peace Corps again in Panama two th- +thousand two thousand eleven which I do have written there,22.523
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_40.txt,so three years ago they were looking for a librarian on a six month assignment that you didn't have to do the full twenty-seven months and they were starting a library and I said okay let's do it.,12.222
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_41.txt,Fun {LG} fun {LG} I mean really I -- I -- I'm not one of these people who came out and like you know felt like I saved the world or did anything near that. I mean it was fun I met some great people there and you know other vounteers and Hondurans and the same with Panama when I was back there. Actually the Panama experience was so completely different,22.94
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_42.txt,and I can tell you about that if you wanna know but there again I mean I was -- I was probably one of the older ones in the group cuz I went in and I was thirty-one and a lotta them were just right outta college. Um I was recruited as a nutritionist which made my friends laugh because you know I'm eating chocolate chip cookies coca cola things like that or you know,22.741
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_43.txt,and smoking all the time and you know I mean I wasn't their ideal nutritionist but I was an English major so they didn't know what to do with English majors so they made us nutritionists and yeah I know this is what the government's doing {LG} so they send us down there and then you know they show you the -- the pyramid food chart and everything else which is all really nice but,21.249
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_44.txt,they don't have the food down there or anything that you know we're supposed to be telling them they should eat so while I was there I got into um the communications department the natural resources section that I was working with and I transferred myself into there and just -- kind of just put together pamphlets and slideshows and,23.053
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_45.txt,coordianted the Canadians were there the Swiss government was there a lotta people were there and a lotta people were doing the same thing so tried to coordinate and at least have um some kind of written organ of -- of what everybody was doing so that everybody wasn't doing everybody else's thing even though everybody was from different government,21.729
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_46.txt,so I -- I felt much better there cuz I had those letters before in -- in other jobs and so I did that and then when I was getting ready for my time to be up I transferred into the capital city and I worked as -- in the library in the uh (()) in the Peace Corps library and then I wanted to stay so I,22.014
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_47.txt,stayed and worked at a home for boys who'd be abandoned in the street so I had a little bit of everything going on.,5.578
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_48.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_48.txt,Well there were yeah there were a lot of service organizations down there. I mean now poor Honduras is really you know like the murder capital of the world and it really and you know I feel really badly for everything that's going on down there cuz it -- still I have really good feelings about it even though I've been back a long time.,19.083
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_49.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_49.txt,I had the travel bug before I went and I had living Europe for -- not lived just traveled around for four months in a van you know couple of years before that That's why I say my college education {LG} was like oh I don't know what it's for you know it's just I was going I went and then it was like I just did everything else so I -- I -- I had the travel bug. I did the Europe and then I went into Guatamala for the first time and fell in love with that area,27.082
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_50.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_50.txt,and when I got accepted into the Peace Corps and they wanted to send me to an African nation or something I said no. I said I really want to go to Latin America and I don't know how I got it but I did and in fact I had to go Honduras I know it's down there somewhere you know I had to look it up on a map and said yeah that's the one I want so,20.079
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_51.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_51.txt,and then so like I say when this thing in Panama came three years ago I just -- I knew I wanted to go back. I had traveled down -- I had returned to Guatamala -- I had you know traveled to Costa Rica couple times it -- but I just wanted to go take this job and the big difference okay so there was a difference the first time I went I went in a group and there were twenty-five of us,22.048
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_52.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_52.txt,and they became like family even though were were dispersed throughout the country we became like family and we you know we just had a reunion like last year it was great and most of us got together and but when I went to Panama I was alone cuz it was a program called um Peace Corps Response so it's at -- when I went in,21.011
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_53.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_53.txt,it was a program for people who had been in the Peace Corps before but it was no longer than a year. Some of the assignments were three months four months six months eight whatever and now when I got out I mean just six months later they have a lot of programs in case you're interested for people who were not Peace Corps volunteers open to all not all of them but some of them,22.212
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_54.txt,um so there I went alone I didn't have that support group and the other thing is I was in a community that is a huge ex pat community. I mean it's just a lot of North aAericans Europeans Canadians and everybody who l- +(()) it's very very English speaking. You wouldn't have to know a word of Spanish to even live there you know,21.548
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_55.txt,but we did take -- I mean and my work ethic was completely different this time around than the first time. We -- there again we partied a lot the first time and this time I went down to work and I did. I worked like a son of a gun. I was like I was ready to come back {LG} yeah. Was a three story empty building.,21.179
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_56.txt,I mean nothing in it and we -- we bought books we catalogued the books we got the shelving we got the furniture (()) take two (()) women and they so I mean it's -- I -- I been back twice since then actually yeah twice I just got back couple months ago and it's -- it's a huge huge,20.834
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_57.txt,cultural meeting place. They have art shows they have music things. They have the children love it. They have public access computers. I'm so proud of what I did there. {LG},10.89

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_59.txt,Yeah yeah I didn't like this last trip cuz I was house sitting for some people so it was nice I had a free place to stay but they lived in a gated golf community resort area and it -- the two times when I lived there and when I gone back the next time I was right in town and I would just be back and forth every day multiple times in town hello hello hello hello hello,24.369
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_60.txt,you know and then this time it was just like oh God I have to walk down into town and just this whole living environment isn't right and it was -- it was different this time so I think I'm gonna pick other places to go vacation. {LG} I've done that.,13.626
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_61.txt,There? Oh it's a lot cheaper to live there. Um fresh fruit walk to the market.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_62.txt,I mean my -- my -- my -- I liked it. I liked living like that.

Like I said I'd walk into town and get whatever I was gonna eat that day and I had a little microwave. I don' think I ever used the little stove,23.495
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_4_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_4_part_63.txt,and just daily shopping and talking to the fruit vendor and I -- when I went back this time he recogni- +recognized where you been you know?

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_32.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_32.txt,and uh take them to trade market and you know you'd get the recycling money so we'd get cash those in and then buy a bunch of candy and crap um,10.249
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_33.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_33.txt,yeah it was just it was a real nice place you know your teachers all knew you um there was small classrooms um you you had the same class every year growing up so um it was the same people you know they no one ever got held back um it was just the same group of friends every year,20.651
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_34.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_34.txt,um so yeah it was a it was it's a nice little town thats even you know when I was coming back you know everyone say it's a great place to raise a family but it really is um my wife and I we tried to have kids um we ended up doing uh in vitro and trying that um for years and uh,20.728
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_35.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_35.txt,just weren't able never able to get pregnant so we ended up adopting a little boy and uh so we have a little six year old now and uh yeah so that's kinda takes up more of our time now,12.657
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_36.txt,yeah last year he was in what they call u-six which is six and under and uh there's no goalies they don't keep score now now they're u-eight so there's goalies and a full field and uh I think they're gonna act the same where everyone just follows the ball from end to end and uh,19.731
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_37.txt,in in some ways just because uh I think when I was a kid it was more isolated uh when I grew up here we got three t.v. stations um so you got basically we we got you know there was A.B.C. N.B.C. C.B.S and P.B.S when I was a kid,22.5
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_38.txt,and so you had f- four networks and only three stations so um even culturally people talk you know now it's like well didn't you watch H.R. puff and stuff no we didn't get that channel we uh yeah oh yeah we were very deprived uh yeah and so just you know um the amount of media that,22.014
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_39.txt,they're exposed to now and with the internet it's so much different than when I was a kid it's like you know they have a much more level playing field in a way with at least access to information um and entertainment what's going on every place um I know when I went from high school here to college,21.557
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_40.txt,it was a you know you were there was you know some culture shock and I didn't go to a I went to Chico State I mean it wasn't like a huge um urban area right off the bat and I know kids who like went from here to Berkley and they had a real hard time transition from here to telegraph hill just cuz you know they knew what marijuana smelled like,20.802
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_41.txt,but they were used to seeing it o- on the sidewalk um althought it's kind of come around to now you do see it on the sidewalk here so um so yeah I think you know he's gonna have there'll be those difference although like at his school they're not allowed to take cellphones um,20.386
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_42.txt,they they kind of limit um that more for educational purposes I think um he's probably gonna be able to use uh his cellphone and smartphone better than she or I do a- yeah,21.269
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_43.txt,just they they seem wired for it um so I think that's gonna be way different um you know in some ways uh I don't know how different the world's gonna be what the economy's gonna be like for him you know right now it's not great hopefully that'll change um,21.414
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_44.txt,I think when I got out of high school I think that was one of the recessions going on when Reagan was becoming president so it wasn't like great economic times there so who who knows what it'll that'll be like um I think the economy locally was a little better here when I was growing up um there was still logging industry not that that's,23.159
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_45.txt,what you would you know that's the only dream your kid'd go int- to but um it there were you know not it's pretty much uh government employment and it was some small businesses kinda what's available here so um you know ideally it you know I I think it's a good idea to leave here for a while and,22.835
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_46.txt,see the rest of the world some then you want to come back that's great but uh,5.935
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_47.txt,um you don't see a whole bunch coming back I don't think because it's real limited on career wise what you can do coming back here um you know I was lucky and that's one thing that appealed to me about laws you can pretty much go anywhere and get a job doing something uh not that I didn't have any aspirations of coming back here but I,20.614
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_48.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_48.txt,I did like the mobility of it and and that um so yeah it you know that like I said there's not a lot of professional jobs you can go and get your education then come back here with an expectation of of really getting a job um,20.936
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_49.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_49.txt,factor and thats could be something as well that changes you know were a lot of people now it's a lot easier to you know do your work remotely you know there's people even from the bay area who you know telecommute whatever and uh some of that changes so um,18.931
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_50.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_50.txt,and that it's ooled off some just and that's another just product of the real estate market it we saw a lot of that when um the real estate market was real high in the bay area and the valley like were were in what Mercede or Modesto area last yeah I mean but when property was worth a,20.774
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_51.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_51.txt,a lot there you know we got a lot of in the bay area we'd always get a a lot of retirees here you know we have a lot of retired uh law enforcement and fire department people who um school teachers people who um were able to vacation up here in their younger years,21.572
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_52.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_52.txt,and then when they're able to retire you know bought their dream property here and built and are retired here I I think it's harder for people to do that now you know you don't see people with second homes or or able to sell their place that you know when you owe eight hundred thousand dollars on your place and it's worth,20.562
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_53.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_53.txt,three hundre thousand it's a little harder to to buy your cabin on the fishing hole um so that's kinda changed um,12.142
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_54.txt,yeah I it's an area that's fairly dependant on tourism um you know we have Trinity Lake which is a reservoir they built actually there's an article in the chronicle today on it uh you might want to check out um so I mean that gets some tourism you know we have backpacking um,21.001
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_55.txt,a lot of fly fishing steal head fishing that that brings in people um so there's some local revenue from that you know for fishin guides some that you know this place you know is fairly dependant on tourism to support it um yeah it's probbably come around where I don't know ratings wise but that could be the top,22.696
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_56.txt,industry for the county um cuz there's not much else here there yeah um there's not a lot for natural resources other than logging and um they they've shut down a lot of that uh it's become pretty heavily regulated um you know we saw there's one timber mill in the county now,25.907
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_57.txt,and uh I think at one point there was thirty something like that I've heard it was like almost every little town had it's own mill um yeah it's yeah yeah something that's really changed,14.555
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_58.txt,I think initially one of the big things was uh the the spotted owl was an endangered species and so they shut down a lot of the um logging probably I don't know trinity county probably ninety percent of it is owned by the government is federal land either for service or,20.922
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_59.txt,um b.l.m. so there's not a lot of private land here s.p.i.'s probably the largest private timber and land owner that's syrup cithc industries which uh Red Emmerson from Redding owns it and he's like you know the ninth richest guy in the U.S. or something and so they would be the largest private land owner in the county,24.505
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_60.txt,um so yeah pretty much loggin on federal land pretty much stopped because of the spotted owl and then they regulated even what you could do on private uh so that really cut it back for for how much logging was done locally um you know we've had a couple recessions and the housing industry's the first that,23.422
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_61.txt,feels it so people stop buying timber so that's kind of impacted of I think um yeah and it used to be you know there were three grocery stores in town now there's one uh and a health food store that kinda you know sputters along I think it's uh,20.281
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_62.txt,yeah and and actually you know probably the- I'm sure they don't keep stats on it but I think tourism has probably been uh is now number two behind growing marijuana that's yeah it's a huge huge business here,18.571
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_63.txt,yeah just these huge operations growing for profit and then it's and everything I was talking earlier about you know you prosecute someone and then you go to the grocery store I was telling you my wife has livestock well the feed store here in town they sell all the fertilizers and supplements and all that and like I go in there and,23.255
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_64.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_64.txt,um I'll see the people who I just got done prosecuting or who I know are on probabtion one time like a year ago I was in there getting alfalfa or whatever and uh the next time I go in there they and there'd been some people in there I recognized from work and uh the next time I go in there the owner's like um,21.444
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_65.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_65.txt,you really scare some of our customers it's like they don't need to be frightened of me after five o'clock I'm yeah it's just um but yeah we really are seeing where and I dont know how much the revenue's staying locally I mean I know,20.692
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_66.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_66.txt,them going buying fertilizer and soil and all that there's some local revenue there um but like you know we even talk about like in my kid's elementary school like he just started kindergarten last year so that was his first year and I'd drop him off in the morning and uh,25.184
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_67.txt,and there and I know it's true in Hayfork which is another one of our local communities that has a huge um marijuana growing culture there yeah it's it used to be kind of a cattle farm town and and timber and that's just gone away and it's all marijuana now,20.136
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_68.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_68.txt,if you go there you go pick up your kid at school it's like all these out of state license plates it's Washington and Idaho and Minnesota and the whole time I grew up here I mean when we went out of town we'd play the license plate game you know where you're in the back of your parent's station wagon,21.061
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_69.txt,sniffin carbon monoxide and picking the license plates from out of state and now you can just play it here just you know pretty much from April through October uh every day's the license plate game uh yeah so that that's kind of a a change,18.999
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_70.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_70.txt,yeah well and we're start- yeah and we're starting to see some of that and that's what we you know talk about at the office that's when it's gonna start changing people's perception of it the people who say let's just legalize it and be done with it one that can't happen here until the federal government addresses the inconsistencies cuz we can't legalize it,21.492
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_71.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_71.txt,and have it have any affect as long as it's illegal under the federal system so uh until they reconcile that kind of blowing into the wind for um any change but yeah that's what an- and previously like when the feds'd do enforcement here they would only do Mexican national grows out on the national forest,23.764
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_72.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_72.txt,that's all they'd enforce and still that's all they're really doing they don't wanna get involved even when we have cases we ask them to take it where it's you know we have a money trail from here to Arizona or Virginia you um they're not taking those cases either for pretty much political reasons or,20.356
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_73.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_73.txt,whatever other reasons their criteria is I don't know but I I think it's gonna take someone getting hurt for that to to change and and it is gonna be something like you said you know most like the Mexican grows like when they show up they just run cuz most of them are illegals and,22.723
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_74.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_74.txt,they don't want to get caught um they might have a gun or two out at their grow but it usually it's just to poach a deer to eat or to stop the deer from eating the marijuana which they'll do um yeah I I didn't yeah exactly it's yeah but it it's probably one of those and that's how people get addicted to venison,21.957
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_75.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_75.txt,(laughter) it but um but I think more and more we're seeing these large scale uh you know whatever you want to call it cajun grows however you want to describe them were they're going and buying a large peice of private land that's remote um and doing just you know huge grows,20.463
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_76.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_76.txt,um but same kind of thing where they try and do them out some place and it's gonna be a something where either you know we have some innocent backpacker or tourist who stumbles on it and gets hurt or uh you know uh patch pirates who'll go in and try and,20.454
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_77.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_77.txt,um basically poach a grow and have them yeah yeah yeah or you know we'll have rival grows where you know they they'll have like a property line dispute um so yeah and I think we'll that's what's we're gonna start seeing some violence just to,21.046
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_78.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_78.txt,it it is yeah again the culture's starting to change where you know it used to be people have grown marijuana in Trinity County for probably decades I mean you know as a kid I wasn't part of that culture but y- you know there was marijuana around and um you knew there were parts of the county where that's what they did I mean they used to have,20.913
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_79.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_79.txt,you know almost wars between the force service and the pot growers you know like in the seventies um in ruraler parts of the county um but now it's just all over the place and um you know it used to be it was kinda just that hippie generation who,21.255
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_80.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_80.txt,you grew enough to take to the dead show and that that was a um but now that it's yeah basically a business it changes people's yeah what they're willing to do for it,18.752
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_81.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_81.txt,but absolutely and yeah we see it where um there there kind it's become a total underground economy here where you know it's like once October hits you know yeah they're paying people to trim for them and um you know they'll pay them you know a hundred five hundred dollar a day whatever the rate is to trim,22.84
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_82.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_82.txt,or you know some cash some bud work it out in trade um yeah and you kinda almost see you know we we we almost have our own migrant workers now where you them come in that time of year and,17.244
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_83.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_83.txt,um and you'll them come in you know backpacking r- you know w- well hitchhiking with a backpack and uh you know their cardboard sign and yeah so they'll work for that month or so uh and make however much money ands and then you'll see them leaving town they've got the cardboard sign that says Arcada,21.595
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_84.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_84.txt,and uh head over to Humbled for the next for the indoor season or whatever,7.02
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_85.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_85.txt,it it's about time it's funny even if you start driving around this time of year you'll start smelling it cuz it's it is being grown so much all over the place that even for like myself I have like a a ten mile commute every day from here west and I noticed it last year and just,21.655
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_86.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_86.txt,this morning actually monday morning I'm taking my kid to school first grade and we're driving along he's like dad there's a skunk and i'm looking on the road and there's no skunk there it's like yup Carter someone must have hit a skunk again,20.342
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_87.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_87.txt,there's gonna be a lot of them for the next couple of months and it's just yeah yeah really uh and you'll just see like yeah these kind of like delapidated falling down barn next to the highway with uh tarps all over it and if you drive by it you know at night at ten or eleven behind the tarps you see it all lit up and it's like hm-,21.626
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_88.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_88.txt,it just yeah so once in a while you'll just get this strong overwhelming yeah pot smell once once it's this time of year and then once in a while you'll see like a box trailer drive by and uh it it's either someone yeah processing their grow,24.857
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_89.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_89.txt,or it's the narcs have been out and they just cut a grow yeah it's just it is it's all over the place so yeah and you wonder how i- it some of it's gonna impact things cuz I know even like for the schools it's an issue because um people come in they'll move here to do thir grow or to work a grow and they'll put their kids in school,21.163
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_90.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_90.txt,uh one cuz I think their trying to be decent parents hopefully um but also they want to stay um um as legal as possible cuz they don't want to you know any red lights that would attract law enforcement or any kinda agenies to them so they'll put their kids in schools,20.944
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_91.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_91.txt,um but I think what and Jim French could probably tell you like the offices of Ed you know schools are funded for their average daily attendance you know how many kids are in school and once grow season's over those kids get pulled from school and it impacts um how much revenue the schools are getting,20.332
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_92.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_92.txt,yeah yeah and you know I see the booking sheets come through when they do get busted and it um in part of a booking you know it'll one it'll give you you know where your residence is again you know it's amazing how many of them are from out of state but also what your occupation is and you see this whole variety from uh,22.208
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_93.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_93.txt,farmer to um you know a lot of people on disability or unemployed or getting some kind of uh government check you know saying that they're unable to work but they're unable to yeah so i- it's a little frustrating,21.836
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_94.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_94.txt,yeah and you see them driving uh y- yeah it's like you know my wife we pretty much we don't live extravagently we pretty much live month to month uh working for Trinity county it is not the best paying county in the uh state yeah like our DA's probably,21.567
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_95.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_95.txt,the bottom one or two lowest paid DA's in the state uh and it kinda you know that sets the bar for everyone else um so yeah and they you see just yeah these guys yeah driving their monster trucks with you know hauling their A.T.V's and uh,21.783
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_96.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_96.txt,you know you come in here on a Friday night and they'd been out working all day you've been working all day I feel like I need a shower I know they need a shower um yeah so it it's yeah that part of the local culture's kinda changed some but um,20.758
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_97.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_97.txt,yeah I'm sk- I'm skeptical that most of them are paying taxes um I think some of the the locals who grow and sell to like collective in Redding or Humbled or wherever maybe they're declaring the income I don't know I would think if those collectives are trying to at least appear to be legitimate they'd give them a,22.656
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_98.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_98.txt,W. two or whatever um cuz that's something I'll see at work is you know a defense attorney'll well let me show you their corporate paperwork and it's like really it's like okay show me the binder,20.826
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_99.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_99.txt,yeah it's like um like our our son he goes to Junction City school and that's one reason um it it's a it's just an excellent school it's one of the best in the county it Douglas City's a very good elementary school you know there's ninety kids in his whole it's a K. through eight,20.373
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_100.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_100.txt,uh they do combined classes so he's a kindergarten first grade combined and one thing we've even talked like the staff and a philisophically it's like other schools it's real easy to pass along your problem kid the one who has issues or you know didn't quite master the alphabet but,21.095
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_101.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_101.txt,let's move him along and um and there it's because they're combined classes y- you can't do that you can't pass along your problem because you're gonna have the same problem next year so there's some buy in and,15.265
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_102.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_102.txt,yeah yeah for both the students and the teachers um but yeah and they have a bunch of support staff they have volunteers so there's a just a great ratio you know to teacher staff to students um uh and it is it's a low income area so they probably get some grants and some funding,20.673
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_103.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_103.txt,uh because there are uh you know most the kids in I don't know about most people probably most the kids in my son's school are um I'm not I don't know where the poverty line is anymore but it is a very low income area um and so we see you know they uh get money for meals for the kids,21.547
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_104.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_104.txt,so he gets breakfast at they take like a breakfast break at 9:30 and feed him a full breakfast,7.43
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_105.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_105.txt,yeah um at eleven thirty they do this great lunch with a salad bar and the salad bar it's all organic it's like my wife and I I've said you know i- if it was closer to my work I would go and eat lunch at his school it'd be the best buck I spend uh yeah it's just great food and then they do a,21.07
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_106.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_106.txt,an afternoon snack and then they do an afternoon program where they have snacks for them cuz you know they they all the studies show that nutrition's real important to learning and maintaining their energy so they do a great job of keeping them fed and,16.157
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_107.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_107.txt,yeah yeah and yeah with our son focus is important he doesn't need more energy focus yes um,8.003
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_108.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_108.txt,um like I was talking about the focus issue um y- he's h- he an- and p- it's probably not a a good idea to have your father as your coach I I think they do it for to ma- for scheduling so that you know if i'm -a donate two nights of my life,20.542
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_109.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_109.txt,a week or whatever I can you know coach him and know when practices and games are rather than him being on someone else's team so where I'm to take him to another practice and to other games so I guess it's more efficient but uh it it's probably f- frustrating for both he and I cuz uh,23.35
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_110.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_110.txt,you know he's six and the attention span's about that long um uh maybe he'll be a little better this year uh he likes running around and playing I mean they have no clue like you were saying earlier what positions are where to be um,20.917
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_111.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_111.txt,some kids do um you know and a lot of it depends on what their interests are and you know their parent's interests and where their parents um you know there's a lot of um support locally for kids' athletics I mean they've got soccer and little league and uh football so there's,22.158
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_112.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_112.txt,uh they they've got a local swimming team so there's a you know at least out you know with Weaverille kind of as the base there's a lot of opportunities for kids there and you know if you're willing to drive your kid in from wherever you can keep them busy most of the time um and then you know cuz of the outdoors you know we've got a lot of parents who are into hunting and fishing and,24.707
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_113.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_113.txt,redneck activities you know paintball whatever whatever their interests are and so yeah hunting whenever you can start hunting um you know like when I was a kid uh I grew up you know my dad uh I think he moved here when he was in eight grade ninth grade or so,23.743
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_114.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_114.txt,so he had grown up here for the most part no when I was growing up both sets of grandparents lived here so I spent a lot of time with them but like my dad's dad he was really into hunting and fishing and uh he took us camping all the time he and my grandma and I'd go out hunting with him and he taught me how to use a gun and a rifle,20.82
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_115.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_115.txt,and I did the hunter's safety but I never got into hunting I never got deer tags I never shot and killed anything it just yeah that never I just didn't have the interest um you know some kids are just s,20.163

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_119.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_119.txt,yeah I said that we have have all these natural resources here and I always feel bad I think we've taken my son fishing one time and one it's hard cuz if you go fishing for the afternoon and you don't catch anything it's not that much fun,13.168
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_120.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_120.txt,yeah you need that you need that instant gratification really to uh um yeah so we'll keep working on that,8.836
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_121.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_121.txt,yeah he's a and that's kinda what my wife and I talk abouts it's like whatever he ends up interest in you know it seems like he's interested in music when he's old enough to actually practice and listen we'll he's interested yeah we'll get him guitar or piano lessons whatever yeah same for sports we really don't push him in he wants to,20.711
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_122.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_122.txt,yeah we'll sign you up for whatever you want to do but yeah,5.736

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_124.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_124.txt,and she had a s- a studio gallery for a few years here so there's a a- an artist community here it's real hard to make a living as an artist here um you were asking about tourism earlier there's some tourism but fly fishermen aren't gonna buy a ceramic bowl or a painting,22.202
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_125.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_125.txt,yeah um it just yeah it's it's hard to sell enough art here to really there's a few galleries in town and,10.083
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_126.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_126.txt,yeah yeah there's one across the street from the hotel there's uh there's five windows gallery down here which um the guy who got he's the felony public defender and he has an art gallery there I think his law practice subsidizes the art gallery um which my wife's very jealous of I think but uh,20.156
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_127.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_127.txt,yeah uh yeah there's another art gallery down the street but that was a some people who had you know started a foundation probably in the sixties and left their victorian house for it so it's another one that's kinda subsidized um and doesn't need to make money so yeah they try and do you know they've started a um,22.341
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_128.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_128.txt,art crew so the first saturday each month all the galleries and a bunch of the stores are open on Saturday night from you know five to seven five to eight and you know they'd do a different opening and my wife she'll do a few of those she'll have a show two or three a year and um yeah and you know they'll have wine and hor dourves and,22.189
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_129.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_129.txt,get people out which i- that's a good thing you know it kinda helps the businesses and keeps that artists' thing going they trying to advertise it to get people from out of the area but you kow you probably saw the doing work on two ninety nine between here and Redding cuz I guess Cal trams they want there's some time studies they do and they want traffic to be able to flow from,22.164
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_130.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_130.txt,Redding to the the port in Eureka within a certain amount of time so they've got a goal of you know straightening out Buck horn and whatever else between now and then to make that an easier commute um and so they're spending however much to take out some of those,20.802
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_131.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_131.txt,curves and whatever to shorten that time you know if they did that maybe this'd become more of a bedroom community for Redding I don't know how much time they're gonna be able to shave,13.093
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_132.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_132.txt,I think that's kinda the idea is yeah just to carve off stuff and use that fill in the to take out a bunch of those corners but um,9.955
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_133.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_133.txt,yeah yeah one of those yeah and you wonder how much longer government money's gonna be available for that and how much of a priority that'll continue being um but that kinda changed things here f- you know if it was a thirty minute drive to Redding,21.023
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_134.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_134.txt,maybe you'd see more people moving here maybe we'd end up needing a traffic light. ,7.641
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_135.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_135.txt,There's a lot of people I can t- my dad probably goes down to Redding three or four times week yeah and I think part of that's just uh old bored but uh (laughter) I mean he has to go and get stuff for the restaurant but how they have eight for him it's partly social partly get out he like's to stay busy so,22.37
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_136.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_136.txt,and have interaction with people and it lets him do that but there are a lot of people like my boss uh he and his wife have kids they take them down for music lessons and you know some of the stuff that's not available here yeah uh soccer games whatever yeah there's a lot of people here who are down to Redding,20.965
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_137.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_137.txt,two or three I worked in Redding for four or five years and commuted every day from Junction City down to Redding um yeah and there's a lot of people either way who yeah we have people who come up from Redding to work here and the other way around so,18.139
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_138.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_138.txt,it's yeah it's a good hour you know there's probably y- Lewiston you know is a little closer or so I think you know the closer you get there's probably more commuters but if they straighten that road up that'd probably change things,14.188
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_139.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_139.txt,Well I d- she's a- she's an artist so it it started out that um first we we got two Angora goats which um they're the one you sheer and that's where they get mohair from so she her idea was she was gonna spin the the hair and learn to weave and do that,22.928
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_140.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_140.txt,um as just another artistic thing to do and so we got these two Angora goats and um Maggie and Mable and then uh we adopted our son and he was about fourteen months when we got him and um probably about when he was two he was able to walk pretty well and he'd go out there and,23.104
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_141.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_141.txt,and uh w- one of the goats Maggie um started to get very aggressive am- around him cuz I think she was jealous of the attention he got from my wife instead of her getting it so um we were talking about getting rid of them and uh,21.372
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_142.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_142.txt,it was one of the things we've had I don't know three or four fires over the years where we've had to evacuate and um whenever we evacuate my wife insists that all of the animals go with us my philosophy would be just open the gate they can run away from the fire let's get out of here and,21.615

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_149.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_149.txt,large producers out of the valley um so it'd never pencil out for her to put in the the equipment and the physical facilities that they would require to do it legally I guess but yeah she's got you know her little thing where she makes,21.939

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_171.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_171.txt,um I- I think they probably do but I think one thing about California is um it may be it stayed more here like there are so many locals who just stay and never get away you know I I- know like um my dad I've heard people say that he sounds like he's from Oklahoma or,22.252
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_172.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_172.txt,and they say it in a nice way I've never looked at Oklahoma as a compliment uh and and it it's always bothered me when people say you sound just like your dad it's like,12.905
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_173.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_173.txt,yeah uh yeah and maybe um people would you know you talk about where you were from and I'd say I was from Weaverville a- and they'd be li- and they kinda it's like you don't talk like you're from Weaverville which I don't know what the expectation of would be,21.581
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_174.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_174.txt,or you don't seem like you're from Weavervill I- I don't know yeah um if I didn't spit chaw while I was talking or what the um,11.331
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_175.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_175.txt,yeah so I- I don't know I think there probably are more rural areas it'd be my guess that trying to think California's such a melting pot to begin with or it seems like everyone's f- from some place else it's like my wife's from New Jersey and she's form South Jersey which,21.489
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_176.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_176.txt,y- like her parents definite Jersey accent uh a very distinct dialect you know their down in the Pine Barrens and you know it's not water it's witer um all these things that are very whereas she doesn't have that accent at all,21.933
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_177.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_177.txt,and yeah people would not guess she's from Jersey um but obviously from some place totally different from here but I don't know if maybe now she sounds like she's from Weaverville u- um you know I I don't know if our son's gonna have a distinct,20.672
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_178.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_178.txt,yeah they really do and they repeat it at the worst times too um yeah like you know working for the D.A.'s officer um I told you I worked in Redding for a while and I I was working for the state um but um the dis- district attorney's association so I'd have a lot of contact with,20.572

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_180.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_180.txt,but I think a lot of that yeah is people move around so much and I was asking you guys earler about like um Boonville and um you know you go there and it it's kinda yeah you do feel like you're in your own area but at the same time I don't know how many of them are have been there for you know generations and had their own,21.061
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_181.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_181.txt,and even then like you were asking you know what it's gonna be like for my son and we are exposed to so much more um language like I was telling you I got three T.V. stations so that was my exposure to anything different now whether it's T.V. and cable although although we don't get T.V. at home which is nice cuz he doesn't,21.583

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_184.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_184.txt,so yeah I don't know if that creates more of a uniform language just what people are exposed to you know you watch the new out of Redding if you start talking like the news caster I I don't know,15.322
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_5_part_185.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_5_part_185.txt,and I know even like for me you know a lot of people I went to high school with they just you know went as far as Redding whether they went down to shasta College and kinda stopped there and went from there or or you know a lot probably went on to college or whatever or or do it working in the trades whatever and,20.201

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_1.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_1.txt,because my last job in -- in uh Sacramento was more or less beaurocratic.,13.896
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_2.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_2.txt,But when I was in Marysville it was design of freeways. I -- I led a group starting in nineteen fifty-five designing from Colfax the state line the interstate and before that I -- I was associate engineer,20.044

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_4.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_4.txt,Well then later on I got charged another group that's we're studying freeways in the Sacramento area on a planning basis not design but where to put 'em and -- and we did uh have a lot of controversy {LG} and downtown uh freeways these,20.595
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_5.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_5.txt,interstate five is (()) now and and what is called now U S fifty or business eighty uh those are both very controversial and uh the city eventually hired an outside consultant which uh Caltrans coordinated with,21.282
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_6.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_6.txt,the consultant would say how much this would cost? How would you design this? And we'd give them figures give them to the consultant and then the consultation made reccomendations and then we held hearings and uh,13.568
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_7.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_7.txt,Um something's happened funny. {LG} Okay when you go south,6.266
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_8.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_8.txt,the neighborhoods were just starting so we wo- +would going south uh the neighbors built up around the freeway and in the one interchange we didn't provide ramps to the south because no one was there.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_34.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_34.txt, The other one has the most popular restaurant in Placer County. It's called uh uh wait a minute here -- {LG} wait a minute High Hand Restaurant becuase their label for shipping fruit was high hand,20.296
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_35.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_35.txt,and that's the ace of spades and so forth that's a high hand. Okay so now they -- they have at high hand in the -- in the main covered buildings they have an art gallery a statue gallery uh,20.759
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_36.txt,things like that -- art type things and they built a conservatory of all glass that on three sides is all glass and the other side ties into one of the existing buildings and that's the kitchen and uh they're primarily serve food on week days,21.052
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_37.txt,starting uh we- +wednesday Tuesday or Wednesday and they serve some weekend dinners. I think it's Friday and Saturday but it's a wonderful place to have lunch or dinner so but the rest of the town still looks almost like it did you know in the nineteen thirties.,21.499
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_38.txt,Now the grammar school I went to was taken down but a new one built in the same place in Lumis. It ha- +had Lumis had a great big um backyard you might say (()) so the back forty you might call it is where they had boy scout jamborees and thigs like that.,22.549
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_39.txt,The high school I went to on Auburn there's one building and wing that still exists. Uh the -- the main building up above has been redone but Auburn has changed the most because uh there's so much development,20.692
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_40.txt,between Auburn and Grass Valley particularly starting out and if you go up interstate eighty uh beyond Auburn you see all of these houses on every hill you know.,12.058
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_41.txt,Now Rockland is -- is also s- +(()) uh you know part of Placer County and uh but it wasn' tin the fruit end. It uh -- it was kind of flourishing because that's where the granite quarries were. There was a granite quarry in Penryn too years and years ago,24.104
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_42.txt,but that petered out. The quality granite uh turned to be not so good quality and to this day they they are a number of -- of uh holes in the ground where they took out granite. They're -- they're fenced.,17.378
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_43.txt,Okay at least in Penryn because once it closed down some of 'em might have moved to (()) but the family stayed there and -- and became farme- +farmer uh ranchers.,12.654
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_44.txt,Yeah because they had the (()) Japanese strip town that had all kinds of Japanese things.,7.587
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_45.txt,Oh yeah yeah (()) That's one to ten. (()) what time is it? That's about all I remember {LG} but uh the -- I didn't -- uh see them as any different than me.,21.216
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_46.txt,In high school it was fewer Japanese because there was a greater -- the -- the kids who went to Lumis Grammar School were divided by a line. Those went to Roosevelt and those this side went to Auburn.,15.569
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_47.txt,No they had di- +districts uh the districts were set up some time ago and actually I -- we lived in the district that was supposed to go to Penryn Grammar School but the Lumis had a bus going right by our house,20.278
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_48.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_48.txt,and then my first yet of high school had to ride the bicycle to Penryn to get a bus but after that the bus came very close you know. I didn't have a problem.,11.177
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_49.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_49.txt,Yes yeah I remember walking with one -- our last day I saw her you know we're we're walking back from the bus -- but stop and and uh -- and uh saying goodbye.  She ended up staying in New York yeah. I don't know where the was interned but -- but uh,20.856
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_50.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_50.txt,she decided not to come back. Others came back and some of 'em re- +returned returned to ranching and others by that time their kids were my age and they took jobs in -- in -- for the state or all - all kinds of different jobs.,21.149
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_51.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_51.txt,Oh they had -- they had advance warning I think of several months yeah. Yeah because it was -- first place they had to set up camps,9.673
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_52.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_52.txt,Well we knew they were going but I don't know we talked about it particularly. It was just something that happened and we were there. ,12.142
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_53.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_53.txt,Well we must've we must've talked about it but you know it was -- it was uh happening you know?,7.035
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_54.txt,It uh I -- I guess we -- I guess we didn't know at that time where she would go with her family or what kind of facility they would have cuz theyplace the internment camps at in -- in -- in -- in uh Arizona and Colorado and all over,20.137
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_55.txt,Okay I -- i graduated from high school and signed up for a Navy program  that didn't uh take effect for years so I spent a year uh in junior college uh taking regular subjects.,18.024
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_56.txt,Auburn High School was originally a high school then they added a junior college on the same campus. Different buildings same gymnasium and uh it was course not large. Now th eoutcome of that high school is um,21.094
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_57.txt,trying to think whether if they call the district but -- but they have a high school in Auburn Lumis Colfax. Now they're a big distance now yeah. But uh I -- I just don't um think things that happened then they just happened,21.473
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_58.txt,Okay so when the navy called  nearly all of the people who showed up at Austin for the navy were from California  and they -- at that point they asked us to choose one of the engineering professions,21.292
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_59.txt,and that -- and that time it included electrical engineering uh petroleum engineering because Texas is good at that civil engineering and architecture. Uh I chose civil engineering because I like the sound of it. That's how I became a civil engineer.,22.234
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_60.txt,Okay while there we took acredited University classes plus additional classes uh done by the navy you know. We stayed at at uh old uh school um boardi- +boarding what do you call it?,20.926
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_61.txt, Schools have like for students.,5.172
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_62.txt,Yeah s- +student student dormitory and we ate -- we ate in -- in a school commissary that was only -- only fed the navy people and uh,13.779
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_63.txt,I think in forty-four year mhm because I think I graduated in -- in forty-seven yeah but uh it was -- it was uh a good experience being in Austin. Entirely different.,17.921
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_64.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_64.txt,And -- and there weren't many students because uh most of the -- most everyone was drafted if -- if they didn't get in a program that they applied for.,14.44
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_65.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_65.txt,Yeah in other words I was -- I was on the draft list but before they got to me I had signed up with the navy yeah and a lot of the people that signed up with the navy who wanted to be aviators you know fly that was a different school they went to. They didn't go to Austin,22.968
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_66.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_66.txt,but all of us at Austin were gonna be engineers of some kind elecrical engineers or you name it. Okay the war ended in Japan while I was still learning and we continued on and then the war ended in Europe,20.106
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_67.txt,and I was spending uh at Austin didn't have a degree but I was finished and sent me to Rhode Island for final officer training school. Well they realized they didn't need that many officers so they cut half out,20.35
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_68.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_68.txt,so I was one of the ones cut out and then I became and ordinary sea man and -- and went down to uh Chicago for the beginning stars and transferred to uh Florida somewhere -- where I uh stayed for a while,20.535
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_69.txt,and then I was put on a small aircraft carrier and was converted to a troop carrier to bring troops back from the pacific to -- to the states but all my l- +learning learning experience counted as uh as uh,18.509
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_70.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_70.txt,I was basically a -- a ((yeoman))  I -- I you know worked in an office that kept track of things did the provisions um just -- just busy there and of course it was an entirely different type of thing cuz we were bringing troops back,21.205
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_71.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_71.txt,so there was a lot of activity yeah and as -- and I think -- I think the uh refrigerators were really loaded with food. Every time you needed to food someone in the kitchen had a submit a (()) and get the food and everything and then when I was,20.573
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_72.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_72.txt,discharged it was in San Diego  and that was some place out in the country. Wasn't in -- in the city then I came back and spent one summer packing fruit and then went back one more year to uh Texas,20.827
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_73.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_73.txt,And as soon as I got back I applied with uh then Division Highways now Caltrans and they had an opening in Marysville. Uh they had openings in -- in -- in uh ,20.6
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_74.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_74.txt,and Stockton I had because I was an early arrival the interstate system had not yet been established so I worked on various design and construction projects uh until nineteen fifty-five when Eisenhower signed the bill,22.714
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_75.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_75.txt,establishing interstate system and providing funds for it well that's when I became a one of the design heads. And -- and then from then on I -- I was in charge of design from Colfax the state line except for,22.015
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_76.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_76.txt,one piece between Colfax and Auburn that had built as expressway Newcastle expressway but then I also had the piece of Roseville to Newcastle and -- and -- and design. Before I finished the final design -- well okay  after the design the construction department takes over and supervises the construction of the building.,24.642
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_77.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_77.txt,We had to get so far you couldn't do everything by the Olympics. You didn't have enough time so we did meet that and sometime after -- after nineteen sixty maybe nineteen sixty-three I -- I -- I was transferred ,21.809
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_78.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_78.txt,no it wa- +was no probably before -- probably bout nineteen sixty to -- back to (()) and worked on planning the freeways in Sacramento.,11.464
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_79.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_79.txt,Well in the first place you have to determine what it's gonna be and -- and that takes studies and I was involved in those studies in interstate eighty before I became a -- a department head and then after that you -- you -- you -- you -- you come up with an estimate of cost,23.021
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_80.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_80.txt,and the right of way department comes up with what is involved in purchasing the right of way. Now above Colfax that wasn't too much of a problem because every -- so much was owned by the Forest Service so we had the forest service to deal with and at the same time we -- we had,22.059
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_81.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_81.txt,the southern Pacific building a pipeline to Reno. We wanna make sure that they didn't put their pipelines in a place that would be conflicting later so you coordinate -- where do you put the interchanges you gotta talk with the cities involved and uh in -- in -- in the case of Truckee,20.004
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_82.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_82.txt,we went behind the high school because that's where they said they wanted us uh cuz they wanted us to fill in some -- some swamp land for more school and uh everyone -- everyone has something they wanted you know. You have to resolve those issues and then from Truckee to near the state line,22.921
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_83.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_83.txt,uh we have a lot of involvement from high level. People from Sacramento and -- and the at that time called the uh the federal people -- the federal highway administration was new an- +anyway anyway you go out on a field review with them take a look and in general,21.153
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_84.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_84.txt,they were very liberal. Everything we built between Colfax uh and Two Blue Canyon which is the first we had to meet most of that was conventional using a small median width that could be expanded but then we went to what they call divided highways.,23.227
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_85.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_85.txt,One east bound maybe this way this side of the river and west bound on this side and it uh -- it varied from one to the other which you had to make those studies prior to the final design. uh,18.179
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_86.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_86.txt,Okay what it -- what it amounts to you've got hilly country and you -- you -- you put a a -- what do you call it? A line -- grey line and the interstate in a mountainous didn't want steeper than five percent grades,22.061
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_87.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_87.txt,on valley they didn't want steeper than three percent grades. You stayed within those limits except when you got a uh a waiver by the federal highway administration which would go for more but we -- we had a couple of exceptions where the existing highway,21.365
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_88.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_88.txt,uh above Colfax uh was going up a very steep grade and to put another road in up above you know uh you just couldn't change this one and -- and you had to have a a six percent grade rather than five percent grade and probably the most spectacular difference,24.088
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_89.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_89.txt,was on that piece it's -- it's um  (()) can't describe it (()) where it's near and we had to cross a railroad uh and so we -- we squeezed everything in to make that feasible but to allow for another,21.249
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_90.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_90.txt,two -- a lane in each direction and as of now they don't need two but uh the first section we built was up -- up higher  and it's more than fifty years old now.,20.473
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_91.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_91.txt,All the pavement now has been rebuilt. The trucks just beat it to death and they're still beating -- beating the rebuilt you know -- your tires will rumble because it's taken the yeah but concrete turned out to be -- to be more,20.623
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_92.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_92.txt,durable than black asphalt. That's why you see mostly uh concrete but there's a special concrete we put more cement in -- in the batch and made it deeper than normal but that still was not adequate as,21.112
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_93.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_93.txt,so all the new pieces uh are -- are much deeper with -- with uh --,5.256
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_94.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_94.txt,Well I would say no because the -- the -- the growth of California means the growth of trucks. At first the design was based on twenty years from nineteen fifty-five. We planned everything for the future of seventy-five. Well that came by too quick ,20.982
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_95.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_95.txt,and because the traffic is less up there um we -- we added truck lanes on some of the uh some of the lower ones didn't have the truck lanes uh but -- but basically what was built and redesigned,20.031
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_96.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_96.txt,stayed the same except for betterments and uh some of that involved drainage uh then even -- even the roadside rests at Donna Summit used to be a -- a uh is shaped like a tent you know?,19.082
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_97.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_97.txt,A frame and it was very very fitting in -- in the area so finally the uses of it overwhelmed it and they -- they tore it down and built a new one That's lo- +looks it's supposed to look like a early uh home in the Truckee area. ,21.219
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_98.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_98.txt,{LG} It's not as -- not as -- not as dramatic but they got plenty of parking space yeah mhm and -- and one of the things we -- we -- we had to do -- you have to do this is in any -- any highway project we interrupted a trail. Trail has to get under the freeway or over the freeway,23.343
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_99.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_99.txt,and at the same time they were planning the Pacific Crest Trail in that area. It had not been built so we got together with the forest service and decided where we were gonna put two -- two c- +(()) two uh big elli- +elliptical elliptical culverts that a horse could go through but the -- but the hroseman would have to be walking through,24.97
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_100.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_100.txt,so there's one in the east bound and one of the west bound and that's Pacific trail goes through there now and I've been hiking in that area for the last fifty years too.,13.168
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_101.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_101.txt,Uh  I used to hike an awful lot  then -- then uh well age takes its ch- +(()) (()) At eighty I was still hiking without sticks. About eighty I used two and then I found out I should only use one.,20.882
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_102.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_102.txt,It's easier to use one because with the other hand you hold onto a rock hold onto a bush.  Before that I could hop skip and jump across a stream on rocks. Can't do that anymore you know so this year I've done about five hikes --,20.445
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_103.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_103.txt,four -- four -- four -- yeah four and -- and on the twenty-fifth of this month we'll do one more in the sierra and one of 'em is um uh Mount Judith that is too difficult for me now because of the uh in the beginning of it is very steep and very rocky very dangerous if you fell,27.338
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_104.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_104.txt,Uh I would say the trip I took last was about five miles we got to the top of the mountain (()) about elevation uh eight thousand six hundred feet but that's not high. Years ago af- +after while I was still working we'd have belonged to the sierra club we'd go on week backpacks,20.723
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_105.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_105.txt,a- +and and we'd get up to twelve thousand feet uh as base camp and of course I've been Mount Whitney a couple times but never by the trail  and {LG} so when I had my cellulitis and realized I need to come here,24.096
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_106.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_106.txt,uh I went through all my slides and I had to throw most of 'em out. I didn't look at 'em for thirty years If you don't look at 'em,9.953
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_107.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_107.txt,yeah what's the point? Uh the ones around Donner Summit the family has a cabin near there. I put on a C D and I put on a C D the ones around Carson Pass because that's the most famous (()). Yeah it is world famous and if you go up there during the peak -- peak of the wildflower season,21.404
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_108.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_108.txt,Depends on the snow pack. Okay this year because of the dryness you know I -- I would s- +say we -- we went there in July and that was mid season but some of the best flowers had already bloomed so all we did was climb up the trail farther and we found 'em higher up yeah,23.419
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_109.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_109.txt,and when we went to Mount (()) the last trip in -- in -- in August we were looking for the fall flowers and we found 'em yeah. And uh but (()) is also interesting because on this side of Mount (()),22.348
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_110.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_110.txt,is the way the Donner party came up over and this end is called Roller Pass and another set of of immigrants came over it and it was very difficult and it today uh the forest service put up I mean if you go there now,22.31
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_111.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_111.txt,a plaque showing how they came up which they used their ox up high and then had a chain come down to connect with their wagon took the wheels off the wagon and they used logs to roll it up over the -- that's why it's called Roller Pass,18.762
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_112.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_112.txt,and I've been up and down Roller Pass hiking it just like that so I did it a couple years ago and that was the last time for Roller Pass {LG} but I -- at age ninety I'm not supposed to be able to hike.,17.813
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_113.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_113.txt,Okay okay with the sierra club when I first went to work there was a -- there was a man in an office nearby and we go talking turns out that his wife was a neighbor of ours not too far away I grew up. The neighbor was a fruit -- fruit -- fruit rancher and -- and so he was working,24.195
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_114.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_114.txt,i- +in i- +in in the same building. We got talking and he was in the sierra club and he was active in day hikes and so I started hiking with the sierra club group when I was still in Marysville. After I transferred to Sacramento where I was -- I was a -- an officer for the local chapter for a couple years,23.992

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_124.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_124.txt,and the other -- the other years he'd go to Engladn and that's where he did uh a uh what do you call not chronology a family history of where the Bethells came from.,14.149

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_128.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_128.txt,Okay okay I would say since joining the sierra club which is probably in -- in the late fifties or something I forget  okay  we did a lotta hiking with the sierra club ,20.693
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_129.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_129.txt,overnight hiking day hiking  in the Donner Summit area Echo summit area and Carson Pass. Occasionally we'd go further south then when we did the week backpacks we went down what I call Mount Whitney country,20.182
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_130.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_130.txt,and uh did a lotta that. uh It was much easier in those days. There weren't as many people. N- +no No restrictions. We could build fires cook over wood uh you know. We -- we drank the water. Now you have to have a filter to,23.705
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_131.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_131.txt,because you don't wanna get a the bug from the water. Uh gotta bring your gas stove. Gotta have a permit and if you're in bear country you gotta carry a -- a a -- a bear bag -- a bear -- bear proof keg you might say in your backpack and keep the food in that,20.437
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_132.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_132.txt,Yeah but I -- I didn't experience any of that. In -- in the later trips where bear country was we had a high wire put up and you -- and you threw a rope over it and elevated a pack but one night the bear knew what was there. He reached up and,20.896
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_133.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_133.txt,But wha- +what what -- what it amounts to is  w- +we we were in bear country many times eaerly on didn't worry about it. They -- they didn't now us and we didn't know them.,13.926
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_134.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_134.txt,I d- +don't I don't think we -- we actually saw their scat and we knew they were in there and -- and some of the far south back country there would bea ranger station in a big valley and -- and you could talk with him you know and -- and uh so but I -- I --,21.12
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_135.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_135.txt,I don't think there's anywhere you can go now and not be in bears' -- uh the people who live in Lake Tahoe have bear break ins all the time. I only saw one bear I can remember and it was -- it was close by Donner Summit but he was walking way over there and we were over here,20.514
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_136.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_136.txt,Okay there was a heart atttack once {LG} and it was my trip. It was after I retired and I had three other retired people and we were going to a new place andn this guy had just retired and -- and on the way in,20.684
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_137.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_137.txt,he began feeling not too well and I said well maybe it's the altitude and we stopped for lunch and he said alright. Told him to drink some water. Well that didn't taste good either. Finally we decided that he was sick from altitude so we were going towards a small bridge up,20.797
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_138.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_138.txt,for four of us one other person started with him going back and -- and another person and I went to our destination and we came back we caught up with him and determined that the guy who got sick couldn't go any farther so  two of 'em went back to the car,21.754
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_139.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_139.txt,it -- by that time we had cell phones you know but they were in the car. {LG} We had no -- no -- no uh,7.979
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_140.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_140.txt,so we went down to the U S forty -- old U S forty and con- +contacted did nine eleven a- +and and the uh Donner Summit firemen rescue squad came out,10.728
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_141.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_141.txt,cut it and uh after checking -- it was -- it was a regular type ambulance. They got everything in it for -- for rescue. They did a E K G and everything and they thought he had a heart problem so they radioed in to the Truckee hospital. Have a car- +cardiology cardiology uh man there,20.638
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_142.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_142.txt,when we bring him in so they took him to the hospital. He had a -- a -- cl- +clogged one -- one uh thing clogged,8.705
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_143.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_143.txt,and uh they kept him for a while. They cleared it up and uh he was a joker. He says well -- he called his wife and she was coming right up and he told -- told the nurse there well get me a bigger bed I want my -- my wife's coming up {LG} but eventually that -- that was a bad sign for him,22.953
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_144.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_144.txt,cuz he eventually had to have uh stints put in and then the final one was -- was a bad stroke.,7.932
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_145.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_145.txt,so my -- mantra with my grandmother -- other brother having strokes you know is everything but a stroke so I got a good cardiologist. {LG} And I have a problem too yeah,20.693
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_146.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_146.txt,but I can work with it yeah. It's a case -- it's a case that I can't do as much as I used to do but if I do it slower I can do it.,11.555
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_147.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_147.txt,where where I'm coming from is sort of like what the (()) did. Bakersfield was southern California and s- +the California State Association of you know auto association was the west because the central valley,20.314
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_148.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_148.txt,you know all the water coming down goes out here except for up high. These these I consider is as -- as uh Redding and above you know.,14.349
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_149.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_149.txt,Well probably -- probably is somewhere along the coast too. ,5.676
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_150.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_150.txt,what I -- What I'm is is that -- that everything from this end to this end that is in agriculture and all the rivers -- you know you gotta coordinate the rivers and of course to -- to -- to the um person who's who's suggesting,20.446
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_151.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_151.txt,that we have six states you know how would you get six states to coordinate water? {LG} You know? But um when I -- when I ta- +take when I take trips I would say above Chico I -- I would come sort of like this.,17.673
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_152.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_152.txt,Well that's -- that's northern California and -- and down here is central California.,5.922
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_153.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_153.txt,You Bakersfield you know uh it's a little different along the coast. You -- we the coast is a sort of something of its own right?,10.413
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_154.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_154.txt,Well Sacramento is somewhere near there's still -- there's still agriculture up in here so I would say ,12.229
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_155.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_155.txt,because you get to the -- to the east of Los Angeles that's different than -- than the coast but I don't know that it's the same as this. I still think that -- that um the south somewhere is  something like this.,17.247
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_156.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_156.txt,Yeah because the -- the ridge here is -- is the dividing line cuz Bakersfield although it has a lot of oil fields that's where the agriculture starts too and interstate five you know is sort of a boundary in a way. I didn't put this down interstate five (()) close to these,22.189
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_157.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_157.txt,but uh this side of -- west side of interstate five is -- is  has agriculture but not for -- not for very far.,10.97
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_158.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_158.txt,Yeah and -- and your -- your uh -- you have the range of mountains in here all -- all the way down th- +there's there's a range dividing uh wh- +where San Francisco you know here -- here's the range right here,16.363
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_159.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_159.txt,and I'm pro- +probably I'm probably too far over here. I -- I don't know uh except that as you drive down one oh one you see a lot of agriculture too but it's a beautiful drive. I like that one and um now the -- what people think about now ,20.694
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_160.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_160.txt,Los Angeles and I think all of this area have a lot of Latinos now and it's gradually getting more and more and more this way.,10.212
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_161.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_161.txt,Yeah Chico doesn't have many Latinos but I think it's beginning -- beginning and then of course you have the mountains up here whi- +which which is different.,12.095
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_162.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_162.txt,where is Lake Tahoe here? Uh the peak of the mountains is --,5.213
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_163.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_163.txt,Now let's see here the mountains well they -- they continue up like this because once you get out of the sierra nevada do you know what constitutes the sierra nevada?,14.949
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_164.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_164.txt,Okay granite is formed when lava is cool under the earth it becomes granite. If it's a -- if the lava comes out you know it -- it -- it comes out a- +and and -- and uh what do I wanna call it? Creates not lava what -- what do you call the --,22.933
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_165.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_165.txt,it's got a name. Anyway okay so this particular granite extends up to here then you got a different little uh s- +source source of mountains up here and actually there's a little different source of mountains going up here but the granite -- here's Davis.,23.334
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_166.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_166.txt,Penryn's somewhere bout over here. My father's ranch had outcrops of granite and that's why you had granite quarries a- +and and at that time they were -- they were acquiring big chunks and some of that went to San Francisco to be uh foundations for some of the early buildings down there,20.203
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_167.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_167.txt,and uh so by chemical -- by chemical {LG} action that's a -- that's a sierra. I'm not too sure and I forget what this part is called.,12.743
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_168.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_168.txt,Yeah well we have mountains everywhere. You ha- +have you have mountains in -- in this area too cuz you get to San Diego and you go over to some mountain over here yeah but uh I think it's very  hard to -- at this stage you know,20.78
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_169.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_169.txt,we're integrating everything aren't we? Yeah  and uh  if anything you know this part,17.416
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_170.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_170.txt,and Santa Barbara not so much but you could get that in the health plans. Okay I belong to -- to Purse Cares Purse Health Plan okay. They have a different cost if you sign up for a plan that serves Los Angeles,20.679
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_171.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_171.txt,This is lower because you can get all kinds of -- and of course too you -- you we have forgotten the Phillipine uh people who came over. A lot of them are nurses you know? So this -- this area has a lot of hospitals with a lot of uh,20.331
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_172.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_172.txt,Filipinos in them and uh lot of the doctors now come from India.,5.621
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_173.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_173.txt,Yeah so uh but that actually exists today. It's not a big difference,9.118
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_174.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_174.txt,and there -- the -- my parents had good friends and their children were my age,5.245
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_175.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_175.txt,Yeah yeah in particularly we came down at Christmas time because the old famous stores they would have a -- a decorations in the windows look at the windows you know and uh,14.447
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_176.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_176.txt,Well Weinstock Lubin was one Bruner -- Bruner's was another and the Hail Brothers was the third one They had a Bon -- Bon Marchee which is women's store.  I think those are the main ones Old Sacramento at that time was run down you know it was not anything.,21.606
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_177.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_177.txt,Yeah now when we were locating the interstate five through old Sacramento you know well Macy's was waiting to see where it was going and that was the first big store and the mall also for a while had -- the other -- other side of the mall,21.23
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_178.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_178.txt,and a -- and across the street in the same mall was Nordstroms,5.457
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_179.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_179.txt,Okay okay what they're tearing down now was built right after,6.872
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_180.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_180.txt,uh interstate five and when you determined you know where it was gonna go. The city planning director and the city council at that time thought that's gonna bring everyone downtown. Didn't work I don't know why you know. It didn't work. The city planning engineer wanted,22.108
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_181.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_181.txt,uh overhead viaducts on the freeway instead of fill on some of the spots on -- on -- on the town. You come over the bridge and you come down and some of it's on dirt and some of it's on viaduct. There were gonna be buildings above and below the sidewalk. I mean the freeway,21.601
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_182.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_182.txt,Didn't work out On the north south one (()) the um uh twenty-nine thirtieth street freeway. The same thing we put in specific blocks that could be built over or used underneath. Well the closest they got to building over it,20.453
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_183.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_183.txt,was building alongside of it and if you go on on -- on -- on that about opposite the Sutter Hospital you'll see some buildings coming up on either side of the freeway but they don't go over the freeway. Um it just didn't take and I think it didn't take because the -- the outlying shopping centers like Arden Faire,22.793
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_184.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_184.txt,and there's a big one outta Easterly that uh uh were more convenient it -- the suburban people didn't come in to downtown.,10.89
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_185.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_185.txt,Okay ever since uh the -- after the freeway was built there's been a -- a Macy's here  where they -- they're tearing down the buildings now but they're leaving one of the Macy's up will stay there in the after condition for building the new -- new uh King's Arena.,21.141
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_186.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_186.txt,Okay but they may expand you don't know -- what Macy's did they built they're the closest to the freeway they built a big garage and -- and serviced a building over here that stays when they build a new arena.,20.281
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_187.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_187.txt,Uh Weinstock Lubin had a big department store down this way and they when they close their one further in they -- they -- Macy's took it over so Macy's had two separate stores uh down where the arena is -- is gonna be I mean yeah,20.026
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_188.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_188.txt,and uh but I think part -- part of the problem is it was so attractive to live in the suburbs. They -- they weren't crowded uh they had upscale things yeah but the -- I'm not a -- I'm not a what do you call a futurist there. I can't pre- +predict I can't give you the reasons.,23.667
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_189.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_189.txt,Oh oh yeah nothing -- nothing out there before the war yeah nothing out there.,5.146
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_190.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_190.txt,so first of all they had to get the levys uh I don't know ((whether)) you -- you you've been out near Sac State or not but there -- there is a pedestrian bridge that goes over the thing there and if you go on the other side of it that would be underwater nearly every winter.,18.878
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_191.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_191.txt,Yeah it's only because of the levys that that was reclaimed and that'sa very desirable area too.,6.838
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_192.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_192.txt,Yeah Some gorgeous homes just -- just uh a little ways out.,5.636
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_193.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_193.txt,Yeah but that's been well let's see many years ago yeah.,7.432
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_194.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_194.txt,Well I really don't know except that -- that the H Street bridge which we go across to get into that area had been there for many years but the levys had to be raised. They were August levys for -- for quite a while but I -- I just don't know that,22.427
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_195.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_195.txt,cuz they have a -- they -- they had a core of engineers had a plan and everything and that was totally inadequate and they're still {LG} trying to work that out,11.856
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_196.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_196.txt,but -- but the other thing I would s- +say mention about the downtown -- Macy's had a parking lot above ground but the mall itself had underground parking and a person coming to the town didn't see it.,19.32
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_197.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_197.txt,Y- +you you -- there was a little slot over here and you went down and it's two levels of parking u- +underneath underneath the stores and uh uh {LG} uh I -- I -- I -- maybe that's the reason but I still think it -- the competition from the -- the newer a- +and and the more diverse,21.263

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_209.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_209.txt,Yeah Sacramento was -- used to be much better culturally now than now because the -- they had a pretty active symphony and -- and uh um opera program and they were (()) belly up. They're gone.,19.284
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_210.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_210.txt,Well last year they tried to combine the two and see if it would -- would uh work but it didn't so there's no -- there's no uh performances this fall and they're trying to determine whether they should dissolve it permanently or not.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_6_part_214.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_6_part_214.txt,and he was a good conductor but there weren't enough big corporate donors and that is what's killing both of them. On the other hand the ballet is thriving.,13.885

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_23.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_23.txt,weird cuz normally my mom would've -- they'd go down they'd open up and then she'd take us some place or whatever and um  we went away to camp -- Optimus Camp that year  and uh  came home and all our relatives were here and,21.009
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_24.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_24.txt,our father was gone so  anyway then I finished uh elementary school and I went to (()) Nothing extraordinary  between uh then and uh the end of high school.,18.314
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_25.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_25.txt,I can't even speculate on what I would've turned out to be. Uh I certainly would not have been a theater teacher. The -- you just that wasn't something you did if you came from (()). You -- you know you were  a mechanic or you worked in farms or lotta my friend's parents worked in the fields,26.015
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_26.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_26.txt,uh  that's how they made their living after the dust bowl.,6.406
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_27.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_27.txt,almost totally and then um (()) migrated to north Salinas  and then  Hispanics came into (()) because that's where the cheapest housing was. That's why my parents bought a house there. I think they paid something like twenty-three hundred,23.781
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_28.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_28.txt,for their house in I think it was thirty-nine. Um but they could see when their house was put up on Valencia Street they could see all the way over to ((Car)) Lake if you if you've got your little map there.,14.061
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_29.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_29.txt,And that's Car Lake and matter of fact there's a -- uh creak that runs through the golf course and all the way out to north Salinas and a few years back somebody actually caught a salmon in north Salinas {LG},17.599
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_30.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_30.txt,so anyway then I went to uh  uh into the air force and uh got married and uh  came back from the air force finished my education. I'd always been involved in theater here in town at Hartnell. I did go to Hartnell too,20.144
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_31.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_31.txt, and uh  so anyway I got my degree in -- in Hayward and I came back home and the first day I substituted at Salinas High the theater teacher there quit. {LG} He said I don't like this.,21.309
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_32.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_32.txt,He'd only been there one year so  I immediately went up to the office and applied and uh  i- +initially initially there was an opening at (()) High and  Salinas High and I was a little reluctant to go back to the school I graduated from,20.991
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_33.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_33.txt,because there were lots of teachers there that I just dind't know how do you talk to your ex teachers? Well quite thank you but {LG} anyway there was also a job at (()) and I applied for that job uh they have a nice little theater out there but their drama teacher quit and then said no he wanted to keep on teaching and so that job disappeared,26.605
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_34.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_34.txt,so the only one available was Salinas High so I took that job and stayed in it forever. {LG},7.894
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_35.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_35.txt,Oh yeah I loved it. I loved -- I loved working in the theater. Uh I eventually gave it up the school was being uh renovated and the auditorium was gone and I would do plays over at Washington Middle school because I also taught drama over there so I would get the kids in the seventh grade and keep 'em til they were seniors.,24.033
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_36.txt,We won lots of awards cuz by the time they were sophomores I'd justthrow 'em scripts and say here you do it {LG} and I'll check it when you're through. {LG},9.414

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_39.txt,and now he -- this year he stopped teacher drama so I -- this is pro- +probably that's probably it. I'm probably done although my granddaughter just graduated from Notre Dame in fifteen so I -- I wanted to take the opportunity to direct her so we did Grease over there a couple years ago,22.698
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_40.txt,and uh  she was in that but that's probably the last play I'll -- I'll do,7.984

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_69.txt,Oh if you look into the history of Salinas you'll see the name Big Jim (())  He was a country and western singer that  almost  made it to like Grand Old Opry and things like that and,22.039

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_126.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_126.txt,No no it was mostly on weekends mostly at night. There was a Mel's drive in uh that is now let's see what's -- well Foster Freeze the current Foster Freeze is right across the street from the old Foster Freeze  which is right in front of the high school -- well it was just across the street was the old Foster Freeze,22.728
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_127.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_127.txt,and then down was Mel's  drive in and we used to -- when I first started dragging Main you'd go from Mel's that was the turn around all the way down to (()) and turn by the bus station -- the old bus station here and then you'd start back up again. Well eventually it narrowed to --,23.55
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_128.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_128.txt, I guess people wanted to be seen more often. {LG} It narrowed to you would turn at Mel's and you would turn at John Street. Now John Street's one way right now on that side of Main -- the high school side of Main and -- but back then it wasn't and we would --,22.11
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_129.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_129.txt,we'd make the turn come back. Now I remember I don't know who they are now but I remember we used to get in water balloon fights and then we got into heavier weapon. We -- we would get uh uh fire extinguishers,21.869
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_130.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_130.txt, and there were uh whole bunch of I don't know where they were Iraqi or Iranian students that were going to Hartnell at the time and we'd get in water fights with those guys. {LG} They're probably the same guys that held our troops. They're about the same age as I am. {LG},22.928
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_131.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_131.txt, But there was a -- Hartnell was a uh  I don't know a -- sister school or some sort where they would send these guys to school so they could learn English and then I guess they'd go on to the bigger schools,17.749
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_132.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_132.txt,brief time between  sixty-four and sixty-six.,8.235
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_133.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_133.txt,Well I have to tell you the most memorable thing of my youth was I had a job at -- first I tried the fields and I lasted seven days fell asleep at a party and said I don't think this is for me  so I went to work and I got a job at the Sky View Drive in,22.897
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_134.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_134.txt,It was on uh Sanborne Road. You know where Jen's Market is?  If you go down San Borne Road there's a pink market on the right and I don't know what's over here now. Maybe a -- maybe a C V S or something like that but that was a drive in right there and it was only I don't know three minutes from my house on Valencia Street,27.213
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_135.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_135.txt,so  I got a job there. I gotta say that's the best job I ever had. Got to see all the girls. Got to talk to 'em. Made a few money. All the food I wanted.,13.646
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_136.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_136.txt,I -- I was there for at least four years so sixty-two is when I got that job. I was a junior  and uh  that was a great job. {LG}  Uh and then at night they'd send me out to watch the back gate cuz there was the auto movies that was on Market Street,21.452
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_137.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_137.txt,who had the big spikes so if you left and tried to come back you'd pop your tires. Well if you were at the Sky View there was just a gate to leave -- no spikes so people would wait til around ten-thirty or so and then they'd try to get in so they'd hire me to stay there another hour,22.79
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_138.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_138.txt, and again occasionally adult beverages became involved {LG} and I remember one night it was a name you'll probably hear more than once -- a guy named Burt Cahoon uh you'll probably hear of the Cahoon family. They're -- they were quite prominent around here.,20.02
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_139.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_139.txt,Probably in Steinbeck's books I don't know but anyway Burt was a deputy sheriff and uh  he'd come int here -- they'd come in late at night and they'd just make a rounds cuz this was before Salinas was incorporated or (()) was incorporated so it was a responsibility of the sheriff's department,20.844
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_140.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_140.txt, so he'd come in there one night and I'd been  {LG} and I shine my light on him like I'm supposed to you know to get a dollar or whatever it is from whoever's coming in and they hit me right back with a spotlight {LG} you know I'm like oh ow ,20.071
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_141.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_141.txt,and Burt -- I come over to Burt and he goes what's going on and I said oh I'm just working the back gate here for a while and he goes,8.266
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_142.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_142.txt,and I said oh yeah (()) he says get your car I'm gonna take you hoem so he let me drive the car home,8.843
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_143.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_143.txt,and then get in there and don't do that. Well th -- he -- there were legendary police stories when the sheriff's department was running this thing. I mean same guy one nightis out on uh Natividad and I wasn't there but some of my friends were and they had a couple of cases of beer and they knew they were being followed so they're pitching them out the window,24.059
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_144.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_144.txt, as they're driving along by Natividad hospital and so finally they lit 'em up pulled 'em over and they still had like half a case of beer  and the sh- +sheriff Burt or his buddy -- his partner whoever  came over and he says uh  you boys can't have this stuff,20.986
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_145.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_145.txt, I'mma take that for you,5.093

She was a -- a deputy coroner but only because she had to sign papers you know as a deputy coroner. She was the secretary basically,23.137
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_148.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_148.txt,but she had her badge and everything and  the -- the -- at first they were in a -- a separate building from the courthouse  and then the coroner's name was Chris Hill and uh I'd go in there all the time you know.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_245.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_245.txt,it didn't matter that nobody knew who she was there was this mob scene of people trying to get in and see her {LG}  {COUGH} and she gave me an autograhed picture -- (()) she held me in her arms actually,13.622

Anyway as far as the demographics go it was these people moved here and these people moved here  and now that's pretty much the way it separated although the more affluent this gets the more they move out to north Salinas. The Hispanic community.,18.52
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_248.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_248.txt,So you'll find -- and matter of fact you'll find all schools uh really racially mixed now. That -- that's the biggest difference. Well when I graduated there was only one high school.,14.502
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_249.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_249.txt,so and then (()) High if I had graduated from Salinas High I think three years later I would've had to gone to (()) High.,9.894
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_250.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_250.txt,And uh but -- but -- but it's still the same  in the small town Salinas it's still located for the most part right here  and  out to River Road.  Lotta nice houses out there. That's where I live.,21.128

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_7_part_258.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_7_part_258.txt,Yeah and they did a really good job in tht they kinda sorta blend with the old Spreckles. I think there's only two or three blocks of 'em but my neighbors in Las Palmas moved over there. {LG},14.819

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_49.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_49.txt,I think because she liked it down there she said there was more to do more places to go uh she I guess she had grown up down there ... and maybe that made a difference,13.409
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_50.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_50.txt,yeah but she loved it down there yeah ...,5.097

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_53.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_53.txt,not really I don't think so ... because the people that I have met ...,6.682
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_54.txt,uh coming in to Bakersfield from somewhere else have always they've been very nice very few have I found that uh didn't kind of fit in,12.564
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_55.txt,wa- in the auxiliary we have people that you know have moved into town and they've all been very nice ... uhuh [yes] there's a few that that it took a little while for them to settle in but uh they finally did it's Bakersfield's the easy place to settle,18.042
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_56.txt,you know it you just have to get out and about and ... go to some of the functions here in town and ... see the different things and it's Bakersfield ...,14.407
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_57.txt,um a lot of the um ... well I think Jay Leno has [laugh],9.661
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_58.txt,yeah there are a lot of people that that you know there's some people I should say that that would make fun of Bakersfield oh you live in Bakersfield it's hot boy I don't know why you'd want to live there ... we went through one summer when I was a little kid and I thought it was terrible I'd never go back there,21.352
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_59.txt,that's what you get ... that kid went through Bakersfield when you didn't have air conditioning in your cars ... oh,11.647
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_60.txt,well we just don't want a great big huge city town then you're gonna get all you'll have another l-a,5.487
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_61.txt,eventually they seem to think that l-a and Bakersfield will go together ...,5.804
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_62.txt,mhm [yes] ... and l-a has gone into the mountains ... so and we are going South,8.38
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_63.txt,uhuh [yes] just like little Shafter that li- is out here it's eighteen miles from Bakersfield not anymore but it was cuz my folks lived out there when they retired took me eighteen minutes to get out there,13.566
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_64.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_64.txt,now it takes me thirty minutes from the house because I have more stop signs and and the houses are grown out that way and and uh ... so yeah,12.578
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_65.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_65.txt,that's one of the things that I I'll never understand why they did it is to make our streets two names,8.197
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_66.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_66.txt,they've happened just over time ... and I think it's it's because a- s- Stine Road Old Stine Road Stine Road it was Stine Road ... now why they wanted to make this one New Stine Road I don't know ... probably political ...,20.511
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_67.txt,then they extend California ... and they don't know what to do do I change old Stine? well political so here we stand with California and Stine ... I have a map down at the hospital ... and it shows all of the streets in Bakersfield,20.375
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_68.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_68.txt,uh further out there's Old River Road and the hospital one of the hospitals is on over ri- River Road then you get to Stockdale Highway and on the other side ... is uh Calloway ... now Calloway was clearer up here ...,20.082
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_69.txt,and then the river comes through here they built houses here they built houses here,6.614
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_70.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_70.txt,uh on either s- well no on either side of Calloway and kind of along the river,5.964
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_71.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_71.txt,and ... so they put a road through to Stockdale Highway now what do we do? this is Old River it's been Old River for forever here's Calloway,13.108
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_72.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_72.txt,so what do we do? we have Calloway and we have Old River .... it's very very uh confusing to a lot of people further this way and this is all caused by the building,13.678
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_73.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_73.txt,further this way you have Gosford ... crosses Stockdale,7.042
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_74.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_74.txt,and then you have Truxton extension that buts into ... or then you have coffee ...,9.444
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_75.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_75.txt,it's it's a it's this is a straight street and Truxton extension buts into it,7.076
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_76.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_76.txt,so from here on I understand it's coffee and from here no I understand it's Gosford I was always i- under the inclu- inclusion that ... Stockdale sto- I mean ex- uh Gosford stopped at Stine but somebody told me the other day it goes up to the Truxton extension,22.11
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_77.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_77.txt,um ... it's from the East I mean from the West coming into town and it's all kind of in the uh riverbed,11.104
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_78.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_78.txt,uh and then it's gonna go over ... uh Truxton extension ... and I think it's stopping there ... but they have to decide what they want to do next [laugh],18.599
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_79.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_79.txt,and u- they t- ... they're trying to carry the people from all out there on this freeway that they're putting in,11.025
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_80.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_80.txt,to re- to because uh Truxton extension is carrying a lot and Rosedale Highway's carrying a lot,6.988
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_81.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_81.txt,so that's what they want to do is they're gonna bring it from I don't know whether it's gonna be Rosedale if they'll find to go into or Stockdale Highway I don't know but whatever they do they're gonna go into uh ... uh ... residential,19.501
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_10_part_82.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_10_part_82.txt,now what residential do we go into an whose how do we take [laugh],5.637

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_3.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_3.txt,and then my maternal grandparents lived just across the freeway that's right here on railroad so ,8.469
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_4.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_4.txt,uh Wayside Elementary  that is um southeast of here as well it almost runs parallel with my the house I grew up in so it was about maybe about a half mile  from my house,15.414
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_5.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_5.txt,uh yeah I loved school  yeah I would've  if I had the chance I'd be a perpetual student yeah [laughter] so,9.874
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_6.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_6.txt,yeah if I had to choose one that was my least favorite it would probably be high school um  just because that's sort of where I got separated from like my core group of friends I mean it was sort of a starting over and which good things came from it but  it was it was if if it was the most difficult it would have been that,20.934
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_7.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_7.txt,I went to West High yeah which all my friends went to Bakersfield  so yeah but the way the boundary lines were drawn I got kicked over there so,11.335
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_8.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_8.txt,um  just from what I understand it was just sort of a  better life type of thing you know uh my grandma was raised on a farm um she only went through junior high uh my grandpa only went through I believe tenth grade  um,20.515
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_9.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_9.txt,and then you know they just worked they had to stop going to school to work and um they actually didn't meet  in Missouri they came out here independently they came out separately um and they met here and got married so I always think that's kind of interesting,20.123
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_10.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_10.txt,[laughter]  but uh they both both of them came out um  I and my grandpa probably actually would have moved back um my grandma wanted nothing to do with it  yeah when she left that was it she was gone yeah  she came out here and that was it she said there was really,21.139
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_11.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_11.txt,she uh went back a couple of times to visit her family that was back there which was huge i- she had a lot of family back there and um the last time she went back um she said would be the last time  that was it she was  cut those ties and out you know she was here so,19.718
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_12.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_12.txt,[click] Bunceton which still has wooden sidewalks  throughout their town  yeah so my aunts actually went back about four years ago um and they said not much has changed at all so it would be interesting to see I'd love to see it um you know her their old house is still there,22.138
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_13.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_13.txt,um so I'd i- it's things I'd really like to see certainly not something I'd ever move to but I'd love to kind of just be in that  uh history for a little while  so ,14.574
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_14.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_14.txt,yeah I don't um if you know I wouldn't mind moving to the Pacific Northwest  that really sparks my interest um I've visited I just I like the culture I like the people I like the weather  um  I h- can't handle the heat which is horrible,20.11
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_15.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_15.txt,Pacific Northwest is really appealing to me but I like California um  I don't  it's interesting that um I live in Bakersfield my friends always give me a hard time about it because there really isn't a whole lot that I like about it um I could see myself in you know four or five years moving,20.886
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_16.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_16.txt,maybe to a coastal city or more northern California um just the same thing the culture the people um  I mean you've been here for a little while there isn't a there isn't a whole lot to do it's a very much a small town minded community which works for a lot of people,21.168
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_17.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_17.txt,um and I don't think it's always a bad thing um [click] but I do feel kind of stifled when there's a close-mindedness to it so that um that's not appealing to me at all and you can run into some roadblocks there and um it's just a very sort of,20.665
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_18.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_18.txt,um you know the old way or no way  here  um but I mean you know it's a lot of people like it's it is a good community feeling um but I do like the idea not so much a larger city but maybe a more um adaptable,21.019
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_19.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_19.txt,yeah um I sort of feel like Bakersfield with as small as it is is still very compartmentalized um in terms of you know the more eastern part of town is uh very demographically separated um you know our northern area is,20.332
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_20.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_20.txt,mainly Caucasian the eastern is mainly Hispanics African Americans um the northwest which I guess would be considered north is the more affluent sort of Caucasian demographic um the more um northeast portion is you know the more sort of hard off,21.853
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_21.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_21.txt,um kind of demographic but um I always think it's interesting that  it's still so separated um  and I think that's one of the things that I sort of dislike about it there's no real melting pot here it's sort of like ingredients still all sitting on the shelf,20.291
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_22.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_22.txt,kind of you know staying in their own uh containers  and um  I guess some roadblocks with that are um you know we still have an area of town that's Oildale ,15.781
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_23.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_23.txt,and so it's still very much a um  Caucasian based demographic and they're very vocal in terms of that um you know they don't take to other races other cultures it's very um,20.256
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_24.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_24.txt,you know it's just sort of a known thing you know what that area is and people are very proud of that they're very proud to say that they're from there and that's their stance and that's something I just can't get behind  so  you know I have a number of friends who,20.376
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_25.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_25.txt,are you know  gay or lesbian or and you know there's certain establishments I go to with them over there and  you know it's a little nerve wracking because you know you get things said to you or you get asked to leave or things like that so  I just  can't get behind it,21.382
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_26.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_26.txt,yeah  yeah  so they're they're very vocal about what they do and don't like  and you know uh i- that's that can also be the case you know you go to the eastern side of town and it is predom- that's where I work actually where the hospital I work at is um right in the heart of East Bakersfield,21.143
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_27.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_27.txt,and um a lot of um gang activity happens there and things like that so you know I mean the same can almost be said there you know they sort of don't cross over into the northwest and the northwest isn't really welcomed in the east side of town so it's this weird,21.746
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_28.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_28.txt,um sort of back and forth that I just still can't fathom exists [laughter] but so ,7.546
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_29.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_29.txt,yeah I um  you know I was with a friend when he was basically jumped in a parking lot so  you know some guys followed him out and  threw him down and you know said horrible things and,20.363
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_30.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_30.txt, um  I mean that was the worst scenario other times it's just been vocal  you know things are said and sometimes it's not direct sometimes it's indirect but you know said loud enough to their partner across the table of you know their disdain for whatever's sitting over there and,20.928
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_31.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_31.txt,it's just uncomfortable and you just never know it's that feeling of  not really knowing what's gonna come of it  you know  a lot of people just talk which but you just I don't know you know you don't know if it's gonna escalate or something's gonna happen ,18.127
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_32.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_32.txt, mhm [yes] yeah there's certain l- there's specific places in town that you know I just don't put myself in that situation and it wouldn't necessarily be that I would have an issue if I just walked in and you know wanted to pay be a patron there but um it's just the idea of that establishment supporting,21.517
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_33.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_33.txt,that kind of behavior that I can't you know that's not something that I that I wanna support so,7.636
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_34.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_34.txt,um  I don't think so not a particular establishment um there are areas of town which I would imagine a lot of towns have that um you know again like up where I work is not considered a great part of town um a lot of poverty there again a lot of gang activity there so,22.48
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_35.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_35.txt,it's it's not a place where I would feel comfortable you know walking like in the evening or I wouldn't put myself over there ,11.839
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_36.txt,no I- I mean what we see in in the news it's s- s- it's a lot of gang on gang activity that happens so ,11.327
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_37.txt,um you know downtown isn't bad they um [click] they are sort of developing an arts district down there  yeah which I think is a great effort  um some studios and galleries have opened up um so and that's kind of where I think they're trying to,20.219
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_38.txt, revitalize downtown in terms of um maybe drawing in a younger crowd um  and then they have family events and things like that which is great so um different restaurants and things down there you know they're fun to go to um [click] ,20.336
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_39.txt,generally the southwest um I'm a big avid runner and biker so I spend some time more in the west part of town there's more like open areas and parks and you know the bike path is out that way so um I spend time out there um do a lot of yoga and those studios are downtown so,22.815
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_40.txt,and that type of thing really if I go if I'm I do spend a lot of time out of town on the weekends uh I like going to the coast or going up north or down south or um  a lot of the just outlying areas ,16.744
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_41.txt,uh it would probably be the central coast   um,5.941
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_42.txt,I would say like  um  Pismo Monterrey the that whole stretch there that you could pick any one and I y- and generally when I go um it's more of a travel trip like I'll kind of go f- cruise those cities and come back down so,20.497
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_43.txt,that's probably my favorite  getaway  yeah but I mean Monterrey you know it's like a four hour drive so um I don't get up there as often but I do love it up there ,12.104
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_44.txt,so it's it's always a nice day trip to just get away  um but I just really enjoy the coast in general so that's nice I can't  really imagine myself living in an inland state  so,17.366
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_45.txt,for sure yeah there i- there it's definitel- very very prominent  very prominent so um that's always interesting ,11.021
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_46.txt,um very very adamant about um researching knowing the topics um you know knowing who you're voting for and knowing what you're voting for and you know my dad not so much he's um my dad's  I shouldn't say a typical but he's very much a,20.501
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_47.txt,you know he was a mechanic all his life and he's an ag mechanic now and he kind of likes to just come home and relax and just be a simple guy and not worry about what's happening but um from a very young age my mom and I would we'd always watch all of the conventions we'd always watch all of the speeches we'd always um and she's liberal,20.877
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_48.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_48.txt,but she did instill in me that regardless of where you stand on any issue and this also came from my grandma as well um you have to have a foundation in it um don't vote one way just because I vote one way you have to you know don't vote one way because you hear someone tell you that on tv,20.831
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_49.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_49.txt,you know she was um she really instilled in me that you have to you know look up the policies you have to read you know and you have to m- come to your own conclusions and sort of form your own platforms before you jump on somebody else's platform and so then that's just that's the way I went that's just kind of how it developed and um,21.933
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_50.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_50.txt,sort of what brings me to my political stances on different issues and  um  it's certainly in the minority here I can tell you that,9.355
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_51.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_51.txt,and um you know and that's kind of the i- what I was talking about earlier with sort of the closed minded um atmosphere of the community is it's not that someone believes one way or the other it's that too many people here just sort of jump on the bandwagon,20.656
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_52.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_52.txt,they believe that way because well  that's how my dad voted and that's how his dad voted and um I don't feel I feel like too much of it comes from lethargy and not wanting to research and not wanting to do the work you know it's just so easy to flip on the tv and you know see a talking head tell you or you're in a group of friends that all say well,25.388
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_53.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_53.txt,you know don't vote for this guy don't you know this this guy's bad don't and so they say oh yeah right without even having really any knowledge of  why they're voting that way or what they're saying and um  this community one thing about them is they're very good at banding together and when they get behind something,21.476
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_54.txt,if you're not behind it with them it makes you very much an outsider  um and so sometimes I think it's just easier to be part of that crowd and you know before it and so sometimes it's it's difficult to you know you can't just express an opinion because,20.476
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_55.txt, you know not only are you wrong but you're not with us and so you're very wrong  um and that's that's the type of thing that sort of gets to me um  uh about this town is um whether it were very cons- conservative or very very liberal,21.537
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_56.txt,I just wish that uh more people were open to educating themselves on what they're talking about  so ,10.46
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_57.txt,it was definitely more relaxed um I'm  th- the area of town that I grew up in and the school I went to um you know the school distric- we have kind of three big school districts here we have the Greenfield Panama and Bakersfield City I was in Bakersfield City which is,21.524
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_58.txt,um the less affluent of the three um our school didn't have a lot of money we had a lot of underprivileged kids and you know it was kids from everywhere at my school which I am so grateful for um I made a lot of good friends I had some amazing teachers at that school,20.773
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_59.txt,um  and so there rea- when I was that young in elementary school there was no inclination to me that  someone was different either politically or socially or racially or it was just  we were all just there you know I had,20.14
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_60.txt,friends that were African American I had friends that were Hispanic I had friends that were homeless I had you know that's just it's what it was um junior high was as little different um my core group of friends somewhat changed um simply because of the class structure that you get put into um you know we kind of traveled from class to class together so,22.723
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_61.txt,that evolved into that group um junior high was  was pretty good um high school was where I kind of started to see a delineation between um  sort of people expressing political views or social views um,20.424
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_62.txt,there wasn't a lot of it again a lot of the kids in my class were pretty lethargic when it came to that there wasn't really an emphasis on  n- on being concerned with those issues um so I didn't really have anyone except you know my mom,20.236
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_63.txt,to really bounce those things off of um so I didn't really feel it college was definitely  different  college I went to Cal State in Bakersfield um  [click] I had plans to go out of town but my mom got really ill um so I stayed which uh worked out fine but I went there and,21.902
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_64.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_64.txt,um it was an interesting mix um what was a little surprising to me was a lot of the professors there  are  don't hold the same views that the community does here um a lot of the students did a lot of people I went to classes with were um a lot of returning students there so a lot of older people going back,22.008
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_65.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_65.txt,that lived in the community um  but uh so I always thought that was interesting  but there was definitely a marked difference  um in college and then  um  [click] after that it's just been  uh you know just out in the workplace or,21.742
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_66.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_66.txt,or things like that and there in the workplace I notice a just a huge alienation of groups that are you know very much founded in the Bakersfield way and this is what we do and we're here to stay and you know if you don't like it you kind of  you move on,20.024
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_67.txt,it's kind of the mindset um but it- it's doesn't you know I don't think it affects me only because I just know what to expect from it there's a certain mentality of  um when you're born and raised here  that's just it you don't go anywhere else,21.343
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_68.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_68.txt,there's not um I feel like Bakersfield is a little unique in that  people here will be very proud of the fact that they can say well there's nothing outside of here this is what we have and I just I can't I can't wrap my head around that one ,20.055
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_69.txt,um but uh so it would it would be nice to to kind of move on and you know  maybe live in a different experience a different community  so ,13.409
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_70.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_70.txt,um  very um uh I don't know if old fashioned is the right word but uh very conservative and I don't use that in a political term but conservative views in terms of  um  [click] you know the husband works,21.473
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_71.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_71.txt, um it's preferable that mom stays home um you know a core neutral family you know prop eight was a huge deal here um  as you can imagine and uh  it- very religious community ,20.176
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_72.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_72.txt,very Christian community um  that's also a big deal here um anyon- not just anyone who is possibly atheist or agnostic but anyone who's not Christian  is you know that's that's a big one that's a big one here,20.271
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_73.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_73.txt,um  we always used to joke in college that um you know the town's mantra should be uh god guns and beer  because that's a ver- you know it's a down home  very  very much a vibe of that,20.357
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_74.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_74.txt,here uh sort of just a simple  um  you go to church you  believe what your neighbor believes and um  that's I don't know how else to describe it ,19.521

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_96.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_96.txt,is how I feel when I'm done running that's what I like about it um the actual physicality of running I could probably take or leave but it's when I'm done I like that feeling or like biking you know doing a twenty mile bike ride and just like pushing yourself just enough and just being out,20.352
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_97.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_97.txt,you know um I I like that a lot any kind of hiking or um  you know it's just  feels very freeing and open and I can't handle being on a treadmill in a gym I can't handle it so I just think I could skip paying a gym membership,21.409

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_100.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_100.txt,yeah and then from winter we get about two weeks of spring and then dive right back into summer  so ,7.419
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_101.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_101.txt,we look at you know our lowest highs get down into like the low forties which you know and even that's not too frequent and we don't we're different not a wet  climate  um oh my gosh I think I saw some crazy statistic that our actual,20.08

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_104.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_104.txt, no thanks [laughter] and it just doesn't life sometimes you just spend the whole day in this  fog  so  and it's like a big deal here when fog season starts you know they the newscasters do weird little bits with it and there's like fog contests and,20.902
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_105.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_105.txt, it's odd [laughter] it's weird I don't really follow it so I couldn't really tell you much about it but,6.764
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_106.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_106.txt,yeah you know that's another thing that I try to explain to my friends about running is I like just it's just me you know and I don't mind running with other people but sometimes it's nice to just it's like a good detox almost like from the day or from whatever you know it's it's nice,20.999
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_107.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_107.txt,there's one happening in Fresno at the end of this month  um it's just like a ufn run it's just a little five k and um,8.358

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_109.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_109.txt,they came here and it they got a really great turnout so  it was good it was fun cool yeah,6.529
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_110.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_110.txt,yeah um I'm horrible when I'm sick  horrible I just I get whiny and I feel like I- it's just the end of the world I can't function  and that's just a head cold  it's horrible horrible so,18.042
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_111.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_111.txt,I work as a data a- data analyst so I'm not on the clinical side um  I have a real issue with anything inside coming out freaks me out blood that type of thing so I stay away from that but um yeah I do work,20.263
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_112.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_112.txt,yeah my uh the actually the person I share an office with is the clinical director of the hospital and she thinks it is hilarious and so she's been doing what she calls exposure therapy and telling me some gross story every day  so,17.33
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_113.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_113.txt,no but it's a lot of fun for her so she just keeps it up [laughter] but yeah so one of the joys of working in the hospital,9.739
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_114.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_114.txt,uh we are actually um I'm part of a team that is the- it's called the Kern Medical Center health plan um the state um issued um  it's what they call the lip it's the low income health program and it was piloted in ten counties and Kern was actually one of them,21.7
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_115.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_115.txt,um  [click]  and it's in preparation for health care reform so come twenty fourteen a number of indigent people who don't qualify um for MediCal maybe because their income's too high or they have extenuating circumstances um will qualify,20.181
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_116.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_116.txt,in twenty fourteen so the purpose of these pilot programs was to start pulling in these indigent populations who'd never used the health care system before and start sort of training them like get them set up with the P-C-P teach them how to navigate the health care system so that it's more efficient for us,20.273
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_117.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_117.txt,dollar wise um for example our hospital Kern Medical Center  um we're the only level one trauma unit in Kern County um but we are also the only county facility and so we k- we house the indigent population the homeless um all of them um,20.644
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_118.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_118.txt,but they don't really understand the health care system and so they show up to our E-R that's just where they go they've hurt their toe they go to the E-R they broke their arm they go to the E-R they have a headache they go to the E-R um a lot of our homele- homeless population will go  simply for somewhere to go um so we're trying to take that population and,22.08
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_119.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_119.txt,filter them into the proper health care system so they know how to utilize a P-C-P how to properly call in their prescriptions when they're running out and educate them on all of this because come twenty fourteen they're going to have the availability to go to other facilities they won't be stuck with well we can go here because,20.947
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_120.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_120.txt,it's free for us um and the goal behind that is uh the the secondary goal behind that is we want those people to continue to come to Kern Medical Center when they have a choice of where to go so if we establish them with a P-C-P and they have a good experience the hope is that when they have a choice,20.807
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_121.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_121.txt,they'll just continue to  to come back and so  I'm the data analyst for that plan for that health plan um so  you know a lot of um budgetary things where are our dollars going different inpatient outpatient where's our utilization at things like that,20.242
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_122.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_122.txt,yeah i- it is but it's good experience I don't know that I would stay in health care um it's probably a good field to stay in long term but um  it's you know it's interesting um I've always every job I've had has been some kind of financial number-crunching,20.502
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_123.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_123.txt,thing and I have you know wild dreams of just not doing that anymore um I'd love to do something else I just don't know what that is  so that always poses a problem  [laughter]  yeah so um  [click] you know I uh ,20.164
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_124.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_124.txt,I have friends that are very passionate about their jobs I mean they just like you know for example Darla's an art teacher and it's just her world I mean it you know and uh  I have a couple of other friends that they've really found their niche and sort of you know they're just I think they would go to work even if they didn't get paid for it,21.137
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_125.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_125.txt,they just love it and I just think  one day one day I'm gonna find it I just don't know what it is  so until then  I just play with numbers all day ,11.777
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_126.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_126.txt,no [laughter] uh I uh my degree's in communications uh with a graphic design minor actually which I love um and right out of high school I went into a job uh at an ad agency uh doing graphic design and hated the industry,20.365
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_127.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_127.txt,I liked I loved the graphic design portion did not like the industry it was just so cold and sterile and competitive and which it didn't really come as a shock it just I guess what was surprising to me was how I felt in that environment um,21.085
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_128.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_128.txt,I've one thing I really love about my job now is helping an indigent population like that's something that I'm very drawn to um I can take or leave sort of my day to day tasks but I really enjoy what our team is moving towards,20.526
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_129.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_129.txt,I think it's really important um and so I love that aspect of the job um  [click] but anyway back to the graphic design industry um it was just cold I didn't like it and then I came to this horrible realization of  well what do you do now,20.539
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_130.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_130.txt,cuz that's your degree so you know suck it up or you know figure out an alternative um and finally uh I had sort of just I was kind of coming to a breaking point of man that's this is just not for me um and,20.114
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_131.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_131.txt,I actually had a friend who worked in with a local financial investment firm and said you know we're looking to bring our graphic design in house  is this something you'd wanna do and I thought  well yeah maybe it would be different if I'm sort of on a consultant level and independent based you know,21.132
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_132.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_132.txt,and I thought yeah I'll g- I'll give it a shot and so I did and I loved it but while I was there um I sort of started implementing other things they had me implement a few processes and  [click] um things like that they're horrible with programs like access and excel and so I sort of helped navigate them and set some things up for them and,23.848
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_133.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_133.txt,um they said you know just through the course of working there they said well you know if you wanna pursue anything we'll pay for you to get your series sixty-five in investing so I thought well if I'm here and it's paid for  I'll give it a shot so I did it and um it was just another sort of I kind of fell into it,21.71
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_134.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_134.txt,but it wasn't something that I could see myself doing in ten years I didn't wanna be a financial investor and it's a very small company so it kind of got to the point where the only this next step up would be  to be an investor and I thought oh maybe it's time to just move on to something else and um,20.071
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_135.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_135.txt, [click] the I saw that the county was putting together this health plan putting this together and um I've been following health reform really closely and it just sort of piqued my interest uh and they happened to have a job opening for a data analyst so I said well I wanna give this a shot um not so much for the data,20.361
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_136.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_136.txt,analyzation portion but just because I felt like it was important  and it was a new industry that I hadn't worked in before which is always appealing to me um but that's- I think it's horrible but I feel like I would be happiest if like every m- couple of years I could just jump to a new job like something completely different,21.024
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_137.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_137.txt,um I like that I like that change and learning something new and um I really can't picture myself in any job where I would be for  you know thirty years  it almost hurts my heart a little bit to think about that but um and that could just be because I haven't found something that really,21.937
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_138.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_138.txt, that just has really stuck to me but of all my jobs this one has definitely made me see that whatever I do I I want I want it to be something somewhat  uh  you know  philanthropy related um I just think it's important  um I just,20.711
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_139.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_139.txt,I wanna feel like whatever I'm working on or working towards is for the longevity of something  not just  because or just because it brings in you know a fifty thousand dollar account don't care  so  ,18.669
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_140.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_140.txt,kind of the way I've gone too so  and it's tough,5.519
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_141.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_141.txt,yeah agreed  yeah yeah I have a  I have a friend who works here in town and I mean she makes great money  b- but just hates her job hates every minute of it and I'm always a little envious of like god I wish I had the money to do that you know or I wish I had the money to take that trip ,20.436
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_142.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_142.txt,but then when I talk with her and I hear her talk about her job I just think  no it's alright it's not worth it  yeah for sure,11.69
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_143.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_143.txt,[click] uh  actually no  um  I have one who my oldest friend we met in the second grade  uh we're still good friends um I'm very good friends now with her husband but I didn't grow up with him um I just met when they met,20.313
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_144.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_144.txt,and that was in college um I grew up with Darla um [click] but my closest friends one did grow up here but I didn't meet her until about seven years ago um and then the other two actually grew up in Ventura um and they're here and I met them around the same time,22.506
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_145.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_145.txt,and so that's kind of our per- and actually one of other is from Boston and she moved out here about four years ago  so and we all kind of connected through the art scene in Bakersfield it's very small um and so uh one of  our friends,20.219
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_146.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_146.txt,now Darla had a class with at Cal State and she owned a little gallery here and approached Darla asked her to put work in and it was like after that we all just kind of  meshed and that's been it  so yeah it's nice that is one other thing about Bakersfield there was even an article,20.666
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_147.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_147.txt, um written in the paper about it um  everyone knows everyone somehow it's I mean our population's like I think it's like three hundred thousand three fifty something like that  it i- you can meet someone in the grocery store and somehow they're relat- they,20.957
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_148.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_148.txt,and the article was written by someone who she's lived here for ten years  and um she commented that  you know even and I actually think this is a really good point even after living here for ten years she still feels like an outsider  even being here for as long as she has and,22.266
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_149.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_149.txt,she's someone who has traveled a lot for her job she doesn't typically stay anywhere for more than like four or five years  and um  the two things that she pointed out were it's astonishing how everyone knows everyone and I think that comes from the you're born here and you just kind of stay  you know you that's,20.033
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_150.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_150.txt,you know just the way it goes and uh the other that she just still feels like she's not really part of that mold that's already established here which I would think is probably pretty accurate  so ,16.114
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_151.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_151.txt,that's that's kind of how it is here there are  numbers of initial conversations that start with you know oh where did you go to high school oh so you know so and so well my dad used to and it just snowballs from there almost always yeah it's crazy ,19.153
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_152.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_152.txt, yeah and they're looking to move back which I'm pushing for I sa- I'll miss them terribly but then I have a house to stay at over there  so you know,10.89
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_153.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_153.txt,laid back like surfer Hollywood type thing and it's so funny to me because I feel like Bakersfield is so not that like I feel like we have been picked up right out of the Midwest and just plopped right down in California  it just feels so different,20.044
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_154.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_154.txt,yeah it is interesting it's a really interesting place whenever I have people that ask me and I like you know where's Bakersfield uh I just say we're about two hours north of L-A and they say oh okay like they have some kind of perspective you know ,20.569
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_155.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_155.txt,I usually just reference it that way yeah but it is um that's one thing that always baffles me is the size and the population of the town but  it's like that continues to grow but the mentality does not it's still very much a small town sort of living,21.737
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_156.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_156.txt,and feel and I think people like that  um  but it's just it's al- it's always even for me living here it's always a little surreal  to just travel out of town in California and come back to Bakersfield it's like,20.196
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_157.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_157.txt,uh are we still in the state like it's yeah okay  it's al- it's always a little  it always ch- it's always feels a little different to me  even as many times as we I come back home it feels a little odd  ,21.863
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_158.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_158.txt,um you know uh that's interesting um uh- I- I feel like they do and  y- you know I've said quite a few negative things about it but  i-  there's very much a sense of camaraderie and sort of pull togetherness but ,20.105
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_159.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_159.txt,for  causes that  aren't always appropriate  maybe um  [click] you know I- it's sort of  causes that they see fit,20.316
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_160.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_160.txt, um not  not every uh I don't get the idea that it's  let's help everyone in need  it's um  you know if it's something that they know if it's someone that they're close to absolutely they'd do anything  um but it doesn't really,20.54
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_161.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_161.txt,go outside of outside of that um and I I think that's one issue that I have is it's a little hypocritical in that um  [click] you know um city representatives things like that will often promote Bakersfield as um you know having this,21.413
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_162.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_162.txt,small town pull together everybody- you know you help your neighbor you  which a lot of people will talk that way but when you really get down to what that means I j- I don't really think it's there  I don't think it's there in terms of a community mentality  um,20.689
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_163.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_163.txt,th- very they're quick to judge very um  and I just I don't feel like  like that that's really what they promote  um but   you know that could just be my experience  um [click],20.408
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_164.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_164.txt,I look at it more in terms of a small town as  um  you know they  I they don't really take to  anything that's not already here change is a big deal here people just sort of get in an uproar about it ,20.044
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_165.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_165.txt,um  [click] I always laugh when I see like smaller boutique shops that try to come in because they just close down so fast it's you know you put a good steak house here and you have good service and that's where people will go um  I call Bakersfield a chain restaurant town they love chain restaurants,21.776
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_166.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_166.txt,they like it to be consistent they like it to be what they know and that's it no newfangled things happening here  and so that's what I always think is so interesting about  how much physically it grows  but mentality wise it's very you know we don't want change we don't want anything out of,21.891
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_167.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_167.txt,you know what we've been doing for the last hundred years we wanna keep it just like it is and so I always think that's an odd combination   it's really odd to me  [click] I also think we're unique in that  um we have L-A that's that's fairly close but we're just surrounded by so much agriculture,21.923
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_168.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_168.txt,and farmland that um  that's it's almost like that mentality has been brought sort of into a city  and um it's kind of trying to be a city but just can't quite get there you know,20.447
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_169.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_169.txt,it's always how I felt about it  and I don't think that I don't think that this community really wants that I don't think they're striving for  i- you know some sort of urban metropolis or you know another L-A or another San Francisco I think that they're very content to  you know,20.14
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_170.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_170.txt, this this is what we are we're a farming community and this is what we do  so ,7.955
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_171.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_171.txt,[click] uh no I'd say it's the same  you know I mean when we get something new it's something like a movie theater  or that's l- that's a big change here you know um  and so in terms of  really the only thing I would say that's really changed are maybe structural things,24.131
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_172.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_172.txt,like that you know  there's um you know like a new shopping center or there's a new movie theater or um  you know if a new restaurant opens here it is just all the rage it's a big deal and so changes like that have happened but as a whole I think it's,20.029
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_173.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_173.txt, very much the same as  it was when  uh you know as I was growing up I remember all the same things lot of the same things are still here lot of the same people are still here so it's sort of just  stuck in this awkward time continuum  um,20.351
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_174.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_174.txt,but again I don't really I don't really know that they  that this community would push for change  on any sort of grand scale  but ,11.292
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_175.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_175.txt,no you know I don't that that much has changed unless  you're really in specific areas of town but those areas of town have always been that way you know as long as I can remember um  [click]  maybe the portion of town that's really grown and changed the most would be the northwest,20.473
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_176.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_176.txt,there's been a lot of development out there housing wise  um  but  uh- that's probably the most affluent part of town  um  so  uh that's just changed in terms of development but uh ,20.664
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_177.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_177.txt,it's it's pretty much  it's pretty much the same as it has been ,7.366
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_178.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_178.txt,um  this i- central area here like actually where we are and it spans kind of um it spans north a little bit um  is sort of like a very um  [click] little difficult to describe ,20.182
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_179.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_179.txt,more of a  [click]  it's more of the older community um but i- t- there seems to be more acceptance  there  um more towards so from about where we are to the downtown area,20.114
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_180.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_180.txt, um and then north over to like twenty-first street twenty-second street down that way um  that's actually called the old Oleander Area  um  [click] is probably the most eclectic mix of people I would ay um ,20.557
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_181.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_181.txt,just I mean any number of people live in this area and it's one of the things that attracted me to this area  was number one um I'd not a big fan of like the cookie cutter houses so I love the older homes here and I like the uh  I just like the feeling,21.191
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_182.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_182.txt,of there's just  just it's totally diverse here and it's okay you know um  [click] the further East you go um is more of like the Hispanic community um  but I would say that central Bakersfield is probably,20.634
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_183.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_183.txt,the m- the most diverse area to be in central Bakersfield downtown area  um  [click] yeah  that's uh  a lot um we actually have a lot of people that commute to L-A  we have a lot of people that live here and commute,21.068
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_184.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_184.txt,because the housing is so cheap  it's ridiculous  um and so they just make the drive  every day,7.81
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_185.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_185.txt,yeah um depending on where they are in L-A I'm- just a normal drive would be about two hours  so  yeah  yeah yeah we have a we have a large a large L-A population here that work  in L-A so  um that's interesting,20.706
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_186.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_186.txt, um  but uh yeah I would say this area is probably the most  diverse of any here ,10.521
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_187.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_187.txt,thanks yeah it's one reason I bought it  was the windows  so,5.353

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_196.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_196.txt,yeah that's one thing that would probably get to me but um but it's a it's a great city it's a great town I like it a lot,8.036

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_203.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_203.txt,I had a friend that lived in Chicago and her horror stories from the winters there I just thought  you know I shouldn't complain about the heat anymore,9.963
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_204.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_204.txt,and her you know every two hours waking up to go start the car so that it didn't freeze and I just thought oh well  [inaudible] thank you [laughter] ,12.308
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_205.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_205.txt,yeah shockingly we don't get much snow here in Bakersfield,5.544
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_206.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_206.txt,yeah definitely check out Huntington if you get a chance it's a great great beach,5.776
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_207.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_207.txt,um  I would probably put all of the Central Valley together  just like that um  and you know well,20.43
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_208.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_208.txt,sorry I would probably include Lancaster in there  as well  um  I feel like L-A and San Diego are two totally different places,16.285
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_209.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_209.txt,yeah like I would consider  for whatever I mean I know San Diego is Southern California but when I think Southern California I think this area right here and I kind of  differentiate between L-A and San Diego  um I think they're different cultures and different,21.375
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_210.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_210.txt,um I think that San Diego is um  [click] like much more of a beach town but like on steroids on a much bigger scale um L-A um I think San Diego has a lot of culture but I think L-A is just like  one of the culture capitals,22.342
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_211.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_211.txt,of the world and I think that it just kind of makes it  really stand out from a lot of other  generic places   um I would put San Luis and Santa Barbara together   um ,19.384
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_212.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_212.txt,in the middle there  um  [click]  oh gosh I would put   these all together I don't really know how accurate that is you probably have a better idea than I do,22.185
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_213.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_213.txt,yeah yeah like the Greater Bay Area I feel like um  [click] I feel like all of these towns um you know while some are kind of smaller than others I feel like they sort of have the same um sort of atmosphere  um,20.617
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_214.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_214.txt, [click] I don't know about Oakland and San Jose but um Monterrey Santa Cruz I definitely feel um Santa Cruz is a little more kitschy but um I feel like they all kind of encapsulate that central coast feeling and being,22.185
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_215.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_215.txt,yeah I think that um here  is still a little m- uh a little more um like okay I feel like San Diego is very much a  um a traditional like party beach town very much like a m- metropolis of you know,22.013
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_216.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_216.txt,just goings on and um [click] more of a  it's lack of a better word uh sort of an entertainment  uh industry almost um this centralized up here I feel is more of,20.479
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_217.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_217.txt, like a way of life I don't wouldn't really consider them beach towns I would consider them coast towns in terms of um but- not so much there for  i- that stereotypical beach atmosphere but just that feeling of,20.191
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_218.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_218.txt,um sort of being at the water and just being open and um and I feel like these two kind of fit right in between like they're kind of a mix of  um you know these are both big college towns um and so you kind of have that atmosphere of like a college town,23.829
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_219.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_219.txt,but and they're not th- here- once you get up here you're not so much in like the beach area where it's like water sports and people playing volley ball you're a little more into the sort of coastal rocky area so I feel like it's kind of a meld between those two ,20.948
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_220.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_220.txt, um Sacramento I would probably  um  put by itself um same with Lake Tahoe I think Lake Tahoe is really unique  um  [click] and  I have experience with Redding and Eureka but not really with,23.167
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_221.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_221.txt,Mendocino and Chico so I would probably just lump them into Northern  California  ,9.735
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_222.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_222.txt,mm you know the experience that I've had um  a little more  uh conservative than I would say you know like the central coast um [click] but it's funny in Northern California I almost get a feeling of,20.812
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_223.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_223.txt,um [click]  like  individualism I don't feel like the cities are as condensed I feel kind of more like I'm going camping when I go visit someone in Redding or Eureka and sort of a little more um,20.305
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_224.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_224.txt,untouched I guess is the feeling I get up there so ,7.22
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_225.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_225.txt,uh i-  here just because this is what I hear the most um there's definitely more of uh like a  um  [click] fro- like a Midwest influence in the speech um,20.516
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_226.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_226.txt,a lot of twang we call it um  I hear that a lot here I hear y'all a lot um so different little things like that um I think it's pretty prominent um  [click] I don't know that I'd really say,21.494
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_227.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_227.txt,that I've experienced enough of the individual local culture at the other places to really have anything stand out as um like a different dialect or maybe different inflections or things like that but I do the difference I notice is,21.932
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_228.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_228.txt,here um  like i-if I go to these other places I would probably think  oh they don't have a like that Bakersfield twang um but but I I notice it here  ,17.639
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_229.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_229.txt,Kansas um  Oklahoma Tennessee  um and I know those go a little east but um Missouri  those are  like the main four that jump to my mind when I think of the influences that are infused here,21.8
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_230.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_230.txt,that's so funny yeah I would never think like Nebraska or Illinois or,6.071

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_242.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_242.txt,um my family would be different  um it's probably more relaxed with them um  but in general no I typically I'll typically speak the same way to just about anybody  so,18.565
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_243.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_243.txt,[click] um  this sounds horrible ,5.677
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_244.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_244.txt,not so much my inflections but I use a different vocabulary  um  not as advanced I guess and I say that sounds horrible because I don't intentionally not use it because it's not like they don't understand it's just I feel more,21.213
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_245.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_245.txt,  at ease with um  how we speak and there's never really a cause for it there's never a you know a need for that so um that would probably be the the biggest difference  so,18.091
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_246.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_246.txt,for that uh he's full of them um   [click]  no there's not a a whole lot of sayings there are some things like my aunt who's really old school um she'll say things like uh,20.567
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_247.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_247.txt,wash instead of wash she puts the r in um holler she uses like over the holler a lot um that's one of her big things um  gosh they use so many and  you know they're just ridiculous and I can't think of them but,20.086
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_248.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_248.txt,uh  they  uh- yeah just a lot of little things like that that I've just always heard them say um  and it's funny because they will like my aunt in particular will tu- tend to use those terms a lot more often when she's around just us,21.549
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_249.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_249.txt,as opposed to if she's out in public or talking to other people so I think probably just collectively we all  we all kind of slip back into that  you know uh  that vernacular when we're all together um,20.122
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_250.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_250.txt,we have a pretty large Hispanic population so Spanish is v- very prevalent here very prevalent um so whether it's actually actual language or someone with um you know a heavily influenced accent accent from it um I hear that a lot ,18.988
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_251.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_251.txt,constantly yeah uh huh and actually I work with um quite a few bilingual speakers and um I asked one the other day  uh I said you know why does that happen like what I j- I don't know I you know and um she said well sometimes  uh w- if we know someone's present that doesn't speak Spanish,23.181
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_252.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_252.txt,we'll just do it on purpose cuz we don't want them to know what we're saying and I say okay and she said sometimes like her parents are only Spanish speaking they don't speak any English at all and so she said sometimes when I'm talking with someone she said I will  slip into Spanish or into English without even really,20.892
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_253.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_253.txt, noticing it um she said sometimes it can be a word like she'll just momentarily sort of stumble on the word in English so she'll say it in Spanish and then just kind of continue and then so um it wasn't really a definitive she said it just kind of she just sort of weaves in and out,21.3
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_254.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_254.txt,almost subconsciously sometimes and I thought that was really interesting  I said just don't ever do it with me cuz I do not know what you're talking about  so  yeah,12.246
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_255.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_255.txt,yeah I've heard that term um I don't know how frequently it's used I think it was probably just coined by people here uh but I don't know that you know if I went up to Oregon and said I'm a Bakersfieldian I'm sure that that would have no meaning to them at all um,20.594
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_256.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_256.txt,um  you know I don't know  that I could  pick one like out of a crowd um just because  I think the things that would make it distinguishing could also very easily be placed in other parts of the country like um,20.626
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_257.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_257.txt,jeans some people still wear their hats so those you know those are things that I could definitely associate with Bakersfield but they're also things I could associate with Texas or you know certain parts of you know other states so I don't know that just by appearance I could say that's definitely somebody who,21.551
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_258.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_258.txt,if I interacted with them some probably key points would be um  [click]  not so much their speech but maybe just their sort of foundation and their beliefs um kind of how they view different things um,20.336
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_259.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_259.txt,that's a big deal here big deal so  um  that would be like a sure fire  uh point um a lot of people are very proud of that so but I I don't know I think it would be easier for me  like maybe in California,20.041
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_260.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_260.txt,if I saw someone I could probably say yeah you know they're probably from the Central Valley that would be my guess um but just uh  yeah I don't know that I I just think there's a lot of similarities to  what I've heard about,20.628
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_261.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_261.txt,like in those other states and um but it's i-it's interesting because w- I actually went up to Monterrey  we- three weekends ago and I saw someone there who was walking down the street and he had on um you know a flannel shirt,20.81
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_262.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_262.txt,he had on jeans he had on boots and I thought to myself I thought  how d- he looks so out of place here like he looks like he belongs at home that's you know and his whoever he was with his wife or his girlfriend was wearing a like there's a s- different work out clubs here in town different groups that get together,20.825
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_263.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_263.txt,and she had on a particular Bakersfield and I thought oh well that's interesting  yeah  but um and th- you know not everyone in Bakersfield dresses that way,10.677
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_264.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_264.txt,you know he could have been from wherever but I just the first thing I thought of was  he l- he looks like he belongs back home in the crystal palace so ,16.989
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_265.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_265.txt,uh no I don't think so  you know about my love of the weather  and ,7.179
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_266.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_266.txt,so  yeah  no I don't I don't know that there's anything else,5.392
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_267.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_267.txt,uh  yeah I think that um  I'd l- I'd really like  I'd like people to know that  California isn't just California,20.349
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_268.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_268.txt,it's not  one giant collective hippie party you know like there's so many different facets to it and so many different people and so many cultural influences that just make it really cool,21.467
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_269.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_269.txt, and um  I mean it's one thing I like about it you know I like being able to go to L-A and just experience all of that the different people the different events the different cultures and then I like being able to go north and you know go up into the redwoods and camp and be,21.41
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_270.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_270.txt,you know there aren't a whole lot of states where you have that versatility and um  the people make that you know the different areas make that and um I just think it would be cool for people to know that that exists that there's a number of different,21.063
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_271.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_271.txt,layers to the state and not just one giant party all the time  you know like there yeah there's a lot of substance that comes out of it from agriculture to um you know different cultures to just just everything and um,21.155
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_272.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_272.txt,I think it would be nice for people to to see that  but I think more importantly  um the influences  you know what how like what it is now but why why it is so many um you know Spanish influences and,21.348
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_273.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_273.txt,do you guys have uh like do you have specific areas that you need to hit or is it just sort of a,7.317
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_274.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_274.txt,it is it's crazy  um  there are just so many little cities like right here  there's  just a ton of them this whole area is interesting to me because I feel like it's a little maybe maybe a little similar to the Bay Area but I mean,22.912
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_275.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_275.txt,you know you can drive for a half hour and go through four different cities at one time down there  um  but uh  go to Huntington Beach [inaudible]  uh it's actually pretty small  um but  yeah,20.537
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_276.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_276.txt, I think it's a really cool project  I was really interested in it when I read about it so,6.609
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_13_part_277.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_13_part_277.txt,yeah so I just I thought it was I think it's a really good thing  yeah,6.502

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_14_part_13.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_14_part_13.txt,went to Los Angeles a lot up to Canada so it was really fun and kind of the people that are in it when you get in it kinda stay with you all through high school so that was really fun you make really solid friends and so I have really font memories of high school and that kind of stuff but like middle school I mean if you remember middle school we're like about the same age kids are really cruel,22.311
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_14_part_14.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_14_part_14.txt,yeah um I mean the kids I went to s- school with at Mistletoe were kids you know I grew up with since like kindergarten who I ended up going to high school with eventually but when I moved when I moved to Parson I had to make new friends and kind of find my group and I mean I mean most people wouldn't think this about me but when I was younger I was very sh- uh very shy,22.066
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_14_part_15.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_14_part_15.txt,um very introverted because uh you know I was hiding my sexuality and um well and at that point too I thought it was like oh maybe this is a phase and this isn't really something I should tell people cuz I know it's different people are making fun of me for it so it's something I should just keep to myself um but I mean kids know and they like to they like to tease you about whatever they can find,23.033
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_14_part_16.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_14_part_16.txt,yeah I mean like I i- you know I would was the kid who always hung out with all the girls and I was in music and I would sing and dance and all that stuff that you know n- not a lot of the other guys did,12.66
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_14_part_17.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_14_part_17.txt,yeah um there was one kid in particular who would just like made my life hell all eighth grade would make fun of me every single day um finally uh I mean I wasn't the kind of kid who would go and tattle just cuz I know it would make things worse um so one day my my friend went to the principal and said something and um uh you know he just basically just got a little slap on the hand you know they don't look at it,23.604
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_14_part_18.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_14_part_18.txt,as know when kids get made fun of they don't look it as such a big deal as you know as if they were like beating me up but he uh I remember he did like sexually harass me a couple times where he would come up and like you know hump me and just like that kind of stuff and to make all his friends laugh but so he w- um that lasted pretty much all through eighth grade,20.48
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_14_part_19.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_14_part_19.txt,so I really hated I really hated the eighth grade but you know I'm glad it happened cuz it made me a stronger person and um kind of taught me how to treat people later on in life,11.295
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_14_part_20.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_14_part_20.txt,yeah actually I only started this project last year in October in two thousand ten and I was reading all the uh articles about um the like Tyler Clementi and Seth Walsh and all these young kids who were killing themselves because they were um being made fun of and uh I was readi- I was reading all these articles one night um,21.462
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_14_part_21.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_14_part_21.txt,cuz someone had posted a link on it on Facebook and so I'm reading tot- I read about Tyler Clementi and then about Seth Walsh who was thirteen years old and then um Billy Lucas who was another thirteen year old boy he killed himself and I just remember um reading these and kind of all those feelings I felt back in the eighth grade it u- just kind of all came rushing out again and,21.858

I was involved in like a lot of plays and stuff like that. I got really involved in extra curriculars once I moved up to the Sacramento area versus in Stockton there wasn't too much for me to do um schoolwise so,20.94
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_8.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_8.txt,I started doing plays. I started doing different clubs that I could get involved in. I did yearbook in middle school. I did community service clubs -- stuff like that so it was a lot more stuff fo rme to do -- stuff I could get involved in that was on a more positive aspect so that was nice. Um the schooling was definitely better educational wise. Um,22.691
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_9.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_9.txt,I loved a lotta my teachers. I was able to get in a little bit better like honors programs and whatnot up here um and then in high school I got involved um again more education academic clubs and stuff like that so that was nice. Um there was still a lot of extracurricular stuff for me to do as well. I didn't do as much as I did in middle school because my senior year I was in,25.681
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_10.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_10.txt,four A P classes and I was in two clubs one of which I was the V P for and I was working so  it was a little bit hectic but it was -- it was definitely nice. I like the schooling out here. Um Cordova High School is where I went to. It's not one of the highest ranking in our district. It's actually one of the um more looked down upon schools in the Fulson Cordova Unified District but,24.017
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_11.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_11.txt,Um  I don't know. I didn't really get to take anything that interested me too much. I mean it was your basic English math that sort of thing. Um I did enjoy the on history class that I had my junior year. I can't remember what we take junior year. I think it was like government or something like that. It was U S --,20.655
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_12.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_12.txt,There we go. {LG} Um I liked that class. The teacher was really great. He involved a lot of like hands on activities and stuff like that so we actually would play games. Like I remember there was one um where we set up barricades with the desks across the classroom and people were throwing like paper balls and whatnot to like put the other person out and if you like,22.836
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_13.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_13.txt,got across the -- across the classroom and hit the door you like got points and everything and so he made it more interesting and whatnot to really get involved. He also involved um video blogs for news and stuff like that versus like regular current events where you had to go find a news article and do stuff like that so I like that way that he took a more,20.818
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_14.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_14.txt,hands on and media approach. It made it a little bit more easy to get involved. Um I did get to take a film class that they brought back where we just watched movies the entire the time during class but you actually had to then critique the movies not just like was it good? Was the plot line okay? But it was like what are the characters? What's the cinematography? Stuff like that so it was interesting,23.582
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_15.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_15.txt,um and then the did bring back yoga so that was nice. I enjoyed that regular P E is not my forte {LG} but yeah I mean I didn't get a chance to take like a psych class like I wanted. It didn't fit into my schedule so I mostly took the basic stuff but,18.362
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_16.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_16.txt,Um I have no idea. People ask me that cuz um my let's see. not last semester but the semester before so fall of twenty thirteen I was taking a full twelve units here. I was working thirty hours at one job during the week and then I also worked,21.021
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_17.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_17.txt,like fourteen hours on the weekend so it's -- it's kind of a consistent thing for me to do as much as I can. Um I don't know. I was used to always doing extracurricular activities and the schooling and then I started working my senior year and I didn't really take a break from that so I don't know I just kinda got used to balancing it and I -- I like to think that I deal with stress fairly well. The more,26.242
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_18.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_18.txt,up I am doing different actitivies it -- it keeps me busy. I don't I mean I enjoy sitting at home and just being a couch potato don't get me wrong but LG} it -- it's nice to actually be consistently actively doing something. I kind of enjoy that level of stress so I don't know. I just -- I kinda got used to it. It just worked for me.,19.889
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_19.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_19.txt,I've had pretty much the same friends since middle school ish. Um one of my friends I actually met when I first moved up in third grade. We met in girl scouts and we kind of parted ways during elementary school. We hung out a little bit in middle school and then high school hit and I had a bunch of classes with her and so we just got a lot closer. Um my best friend I actually met in sixth grade and I hated her.,23.805
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_20.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_20.txt,I thought she was horrible and really annoying um and then the next year we ended up having like five out of six classes together and we just kind of paired up and learned that we didn't hate each other um so that was interesting. I've been best friends with her ever since. We -- she's the one who got me involved in more of the academic stuff in middle school and on to high school so we had a lot of the same clubs and the same classes,25.716
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_21.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_21.txt,um and then I met one other friend of mine in I wanna say my sophomore year we had a class together and I don't know we just got along really well. Kinda stuck that way and I started dating my current boyfriend my senior year of high school and I was able to stick in the area and he actually helped me move in with a family friend of his,23.008
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_22.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_22.txt,out in Mathur and that's how I ended up moving out there too so I don't know how I found a balance to hang out with them. Some of them I have clubs with and so I was able to I do- +don't see them that way or hang out on the weekends if I could and now it's just,14.081
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_23.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_23.txt,there is like the V A hospital and a couple of buildings on your way to Mathur but basically it has -- it's out here and the only way to get here is to come all the way up this one road Zinfandel all the way out of Rancho. It's like five miles and then the other way is actually through the flight line which is around the actual airforce base which is still there,22.281
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_24.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_24.txt,and if you take that way you're going thorugh a bunch of the buildings and whatnot but there's not much else out there. Um I actually had a big family blow out right during my first year of college. I was still seventeen at the time so it was really tricky um but I was able to coordinate with him and his family and,21.749
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_25.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_25.txt,one of his family friends I had met a couple times and she was comfortable with me renting a room there and so I -- I moved in there and I've been there even since so,8.361
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_26.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_26.txt,I -- that's a little weird for me to say because most people are like oh I move out on my own. THe freedom is great but it's like now I have bills and I have to work out all my schedules and I have to take care of myself and I'd been doing that for a long time. With my family life it wasn't peachy keen. I had to take care of myself most of the time. It wasn't the most positive environment and,22.233
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_27.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_27.txt,everybody knew how my parents were. All my friends noticed it the first time they came over to my house and stuff like that and I moved out and it was stressful while I was moving out. I actually lost like fifteen pounds in three days. It was -- it wasn't too great um but once I was actually kind of more on my feet um when I moved out,20.849
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_28.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_28.txt,people immediately started noticing that I looked healthier and happier and so it was just a lot easier because now I had full control over my life and what I was doing and my finances and everything like that whereas while I had to take myself of myself ((majorally)) while I was still home I was still having to deal with my parents and their restrictions and stuff like that so,21.313
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_29.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_29.txt,Um I -- I have a complicated sibling life so I'm not gonna get too involved into that but it was basically just me and my sister. She's twelve now um we were the ones staying with both my mom and my stepdad who are both her biological parents um and her and I get along pretty well. I mean we're siblings so it's not perfect. We do argue we do fight,23.044
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_30.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_30.txt,um but I -- I do try to make an effort every now and again to tell her out for like what we call sister's night or sister's day and we go out to dinner and we shopping and we do stuff like that to where I'm not at home and dealing with my parents and she can get out of the house too but to where we can still spend some time together.,16.276
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_31.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_31.txt,Um it was kind of my fallback school honestly. I really did want to get into Berkeley um which ended up being the one school I didn't get into -- really bad hit to my ego but um it -- it was my fallback school and I wanted to save money and be able to move out -- move out and not live in the dorms which are crazy expensive and,21.353
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_32.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_32.txt,all of that and thent here was honestly the boyfriend thing to where it was like I don't wanna be like three hours away all the time and not get to see him and everything like that so it just kinda worked out on its own and it was just the easiest option to go with and they do have a pretty good child development program and at the time a psychology program cuz that's what I was going for so,21.368
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_33.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_33.txt,yeah I didn't wanna go out of state. I didn't wanna be too far. Um mostly for my grandma honestly. She lives in Stockton and her and I have been really close since I was born practically. Um she was kinda the substitute for the poor family life so I -- I bonded with her and whatnot and I didn't wanna be too far from her because I knew not much of the rest of the family visited her anything like that and I didn't wanna be too far um,25.104
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_34.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_34.txt,so yeah most of them were in California. I applied to a couple of the U C's and um C S U's just to hit my quota for like the free applications that I could do so I miscellaneously applied to a few that had decent programs. Um Berkeley being one of them and then um yeah just in Califronia and,20.948
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_35.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_35.txt,I ended up pretty much just being between um Berkeley and here and then I didn't get into Berkeley so Sac State.,7.706
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_36.txt,I am pretty much yeah. I really like the campus here. It is gorgeous in the fall. Oh my gosh but um yeah I like the campus. I like the people. The professors have been great so yeah and there's decent amount of resources. I mean I haven't had to use all of them yet but it's nice to know that they're there when I do need them so yeah.,21.571
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_37.txt,Not many. I like I have a crazy schedule so I don't get a lot of free time in between. Um I -- I did make a couple friends throughout the time but I don't have very many classes with them. They're usually from like G E classes and so I'll run into them occasionally but I don't really have time in between work and school to take the time in between classes and hang out.,20.414
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_38.txt,I work at a pain management clinic out in (()) like right off of ((Trucksell)) and eighty. Um I'm labeled as an admin assistant but I do a lotta different things. Um last year we introduced kind of like a medical supply store in our office so I run that top to bottom. Um I do some of the medical billing mostly for work comp.,21.261
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_39.txt,I do basic admin stuff. I do new patient coordinating for one of doctors and just a few other things here and there that they need.,8.289
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_40.txt,{LG} Um yeah so I actually my mom got the job -- got me the job that I had my senior year of high school. Um and I worked there part time and because she was there she was able to bring my work home and I actually worked from home after school. Um I had like all of their computer systems downloaded onto my laptop and so I was able to pretty much do most of the stuff there and then,26.304
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_41.txt,during the weekdays that I didn't have school so like for Thanksgiving or Christmas break and whatnot I would actually go into the office with her and work more full time um and do that there and we ended up getting laid off. The companay wasn't doing very well so they had to downsize and my superviser from that job hired my mom at this new place. She actually moved over,22.723
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_42.txt,and they were looking for someone else to do some of the stuff I had previously done and I moved out and I needed the job and so I took it so,10.605
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_43.txt,Well it's not really anywhere near what I want to do. I mean it's -- it's technically in the health field but I wanna do child and family counseling,7.105
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_44.txt,so it's not really related so they're just they're more flexible enough with my schedule to where I can work fulltime there get all my benefits and stuff like that um and then still be able to do a full time schedule at school so I -- I'm basically sticking there as long as I need to. I've already been there for,20.504
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_45.txt,it'll be two years this December so I mean as long as I'm able to coordinate the two that'll work. I really do not want to do retail to be able to work around school so I -- I'll stick to this while I can. {LG},13.747
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_46.txt,Um I was all over the place when I was in high school. I kind of wanted to a be a lawer. I wanted to do a doctor. All this sorts of stuff and then I did a couple community events where we were with a lotta children. Like we had an Easter thing at the park and we coordinated that whole event. We did events at the elementary school one of which I coordinated with the pr- +pricincipal principal myself,25.94
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_47.txt,so that was kind of nice. Um we did a kid's day in the park that kinda thing and so I started working with kids a little bit more um and so I thought about being a pediatrician cuz I was still kind of on the doctor thing but I knew I definitely wanted to work with kids but I didn't wanna be in school for that long so I was still kind of contemplating what I wanted to do and so I thought,24.776
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_48.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_48.txt,I could do child psychology. I could be a child counselor um and I did apply for the psych major but it turns out it was impacted and I would have to apply later so I was like okay I'll start taking the classes I need to take before then and I worked that way and as I looked more into the requirements of um,20.79
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_49.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_49.txt,being a child psychologist you actually need to have I believe it was a P H D like off the bat so I didn't want to have to again be in school for that long immediately. That's a lot of debt to rack up so I looked for a round about way and I found that if I did a child development major and a counseling minor I could do the same thing with Masters,22.402
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_50.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_50.txt,and then if I choose to move onto a P H D so I could just do my Masters my certifications and all of that and still work with kids and technically it's going to be child and family not strictly child which is fine cuz even as a child counselor you're gonna have to deal with the schools and the families and all of that so it doesn't it's not much of a difference so yeah.,20.354
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_51.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_51.txt,Um I finally am really getting into taking the classes. I've taken two so far. This semester I have four for my actual major. I probably have about two to two and a half more years if I can get all my classes til I get my um Bachelors.,16.713
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_52.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_52.txt,Um it depends honestly. Um things with my boyfriend have gotten a lot more serious. We're talking about moving in together getting married that sort of stuff. We're hitting that point so it kind of depends upon that. We've talked about it more seriously to where it's like okay if you're gonna move this -- this way with your career and I want to move this way how are we gonna get those to,22.362
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_53.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_53.txt,intersect and be in the same place and do everything so um it depends on where we're at. I know he wants to move up to Washington when he can. A lot more of his family's up there and I -- I do enjoy his family enough to where I'd be comfortable with moving up there and being around them a lot so that's kind of in the picture but I've talked to him about and I want to at least finish my Bachelors and then I can move up and start a graduate program um there,26.665
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_54.txt,or I would like to wait until I'm completely done with my Masters and then move up and continue up there. I don't wanna s- +switch switch midway. I'd rather finish at least one step and then move. Um if we're still in the area I'm obviously gonna pursue it around here but it kinda just depends upon how our stuff interesects.,20.137
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_55.txt,No he actually has been taking classes on and off at Fulsom Lake Community College but he's currently working um for the Fulsom Cordova Unified School District as a tech in the I T department.,11.888
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_56.txt,That's a good question um I kind of like the downtown area but more old Sac versus like the downtown business party kind of scene. I'm not a big partier so I don't really care for the bars or the clubs and I'm also not old enough yet anyways um but I -- I just like how picturesque it is. Like the tower bridge out there is gorgeous at night.,24.696
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_57.txt,I like going to old Sac and seeing all the stores and everything like that. Um and just general that area has a lot more like greenery and you can see the state capitol from that area and it's just really gorgeous down there and then being by the river of course is -- is beautiful so kind of that area. Um,22.075
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_58.txt,I -- I mean I would put that at the main hub of Sacramento is the whole downtown area so,5.246
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_59.txt,Yes very very much so. I mean I run into all different types of people consistently. Um different cultures -- people with different backgrounds -- all -- all over the place so yeah it's -- it's definitely diverse.,15.856
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_60.txt,Um it can be a little segregated depending upon the area. Um I know Mathur for example has a lot less cultural diversity. We do a little bit but it is more Caucasian based -- Caucasian and Indian I would say. Um I know Rancho Cordova where I lived was very diverse but there was a very large marjority of Russians and Armenians and Africans Americans.,24.577
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_61.txt,Um so those areas I know pretty well. Um the other areas that just kinda depends. I mean of course in every city you're gonna have areas that are primarily Caucasian primarily Mexican all that sorts of stuff so it kind of depends but when you're more in like a centralized area say downtown for example you have people from,21.141
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_62.txt,all walks of life in that area. It just -- it kind of depends on where you're at.,5.724
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_63.txt,I don't know. That's a very good question.  Hm   More on a political side I would change things personally but I don't think that the community itself needs changing. I mean of course there's room for improvement in any sort of situation but I think more --,21.884
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_64.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_64.txt,like how the city's being run finances stuff like that could be changed but the city and the city life and the culture itself I think is okay,9.2
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_65.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_65.txt,I'm not too political but like take the arena project for example. The spot that it's in is ridiculous -- um the spot that they're building it in the sort of taxing that they're doing for it is utterly ridiculous like raising um parking prices and stuff like that. It's not really the way I think it should've gone. Um,22.053
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_66.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_66.txt,other than that I don't get too involved in politics. I don't like to so I can't expand too much but --,5.918
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_67.txt,Um they're building a new arena. I believe it's for the Kings -- the Sacramento Kings and it's kind of just put in this really awkward location that's gonna just create al ot more traffic especially on the freeways kind of near an area that I need to go through to get to work so that's gonna cause a lot of problems. Um it's already a somewhat busy area to begin with so just having game day traffic is,22.371
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_68.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_68.txt, it's not the best area for it to be put in. Um raising like parking prices and stuff like that. It's it's ridiculous. I mean downtown parking already isn't too -- it isn't good. {LG} So um raising those prices and stuff like that is just -- it -- it's not gonna be helpful. I mean I get need -- needing an increase in funds for the arena project but it's just I -- I think it's unnecessary.,26.524
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_69.txt,No not at all. I'm not a sports person. I don't follow -- I don't really care for the Sacramento Kings. They're not -- they're not good so {LG} they're really not.,10.753
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_70.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_70.txt,I would definitely say so even with the Sacramento Kings not being the best team around there is a lot of support for them still so,7.285
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_71.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_71.txt,Um we are in somewhat of a central location so we do have like big events come this way like a lot of concerts and stuff like that so there is stuff to do and if not we're in more of a central location so we can go other places like we're not too far from the bay area so we can go there if we want to. Um we of course have the state fair here so that's always fun. Surprisingly I actually didn't get to go to that until about two years ago,25.784
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_72.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_72.txt,and I've lived here for so long so um there's stuff like that. I mean we do host like a lot of community events like um I know Rancho Cordova for example starting doing um the walk with the mayor so I think it's like every couple months or something like that the mayor actually will go on a walk through the city and um a bunch of people go with him and it's kind of,24.299
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_73.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_73.txt,it promotes exercise and gives the community a chance to actually talk directly to him um so there's a lot of events like that. Um or there's like small concerts in the park that they host for free or for a really small amount to get the families and the community out there so they do a lot of community events. Not just in like the small little towns but like Sacramento itself will have a l- +lot have a lot of events downtown so.,23.097
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_74.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_74.txt,Um I don't get a chance to really go out much. A lot of the time it intersects with what time my classes are at um but I did like in Rancho the um the kids day at the park. Even when I wasn't hosting it going down there and having the community out there and helping the kids and doing all that sort of stuff was a lotta fun um,20.796
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_75.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_75.txt,so yeah honestly that I -- like I said I don't get a chance to go to much of them but it's nice that they're there.,6.72
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_76.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_76.txt,Um Sacramento in general isn't like too violent of a place or anything like that but you can definitely go from a nice area to a not so nice area it -- it it kinda depends on where you're at. Take downtown for example. You can go from like the fabulous forties to where it's super rich area and it's really nice to like the ghettoer part of downtown to where it's like you really should not be out there by yourself,23.97
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_77.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_77.txt,so it kinda depends on where you're at and I know like south Sac for example is not the greatest place to be in. That's also kind of a dangerous area. Um  honestly there's not too much to be worried about with Sacramento or too much to know. I'd say it's like an A typical city. It's diverse. There's plenty of things to do as long as you look for them and,20.433
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_78.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_78.txt,Um  I would say it's very clear English. Um I mean it -- it depends on where you're at. Um I know down south they use different slang than us and their their phrasing is a little bit different but I wouldn't say too much. Enough to where it's slightly noticeable but,21.445
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_79.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_79.txt,not -- not much that it's gonna make a difference but I'd say it's a very clear form of English. There's a little bit more enunciation. It's a little more I don't wanna say without an accent but do you -- do you get what I'm saying? So it -- I would say it's kind of like that. Not -- not something too intricate honestly,20.828
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_80.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_80.txt,I have a couple cousins that live down there. I -- I did throw that out there a couple times and they just looked at me like what -- what are you doing -- like what is this word? Um it -- it just kinda depends. I mean you get those words that are really populari n this area and then it's -- you go down there and you're like what are -- what are you talking about so I don't know that's the first one that comes to mind.,22.155
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_81.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_81.txt,Yeah um I -- I run into different languages all the time. I mean my best friend is ,6.775
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_82.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_82.txt,she was raised speaking Hindi and English and then she learned Spanish so I mean there's an opportunity to learn that out there. ,8.982
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_83.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_83.txt,Okay so let's see. I would kind of put this in its own little thing not included Lodi -- get rid of that. Um let's see.  I would probably put it about here. ,29.06
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_84.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_84.txt,it's very much so media if that makes sense. Um obviously L A has a lot of movie stars and all of that sort of stuff but you hear about like Santa Barbara and San Diego and stuff like that like. A lot of them are down there so I'd put that as kind of a more media and what poeple focus on a lot more when they think of California.,23.947
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_85.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_85.txt,Um not the greatest area of California. It's very dry. It's kind of windy and gross out there. Um like Fresno for example is not -- not the cleanest area as well as Merced. They're not the cleanest. Um and Stockton and Lodi thrown in there it's not the safest area in California. There's a lot of violence and crime and whatnot that goes down in that general region.,24.298
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_86.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_86.txt,I personally don't like Davis but Sacramento and Davis are kind of clumped together just in the general region of things. When people think of where Sacramento is at it's near Davis. You think where Davis is at it's near Sacramento -- that sort of thing. Um I'd say they're a little bit more similar in culture wise. Davis is a little bit more,21.038
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_87.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_87.txt,um environmentally friendly would be the best way to put it. There's a lot more like farm area out there um that sort of thing but I would kind of put them in the general same area of how they're set up.,15.756
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_88.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_88.txt,It's in my mind more of like a visiting area. If you wanted to go to the coast but you didn't wanna be in the bay area.,7.127
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_89.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_89.txt,Very different. It's very distinct. There's a lot more cultural diversity for one thing. Um there's a lot more things to do. Um weather wise it's entirely different. Like out here it's hot. It gets hot and in the bay area it's like consistently like cold or nice so um I -- I'd say it's honestly pretty different.,21.742
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_90.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_90.txt,I personally like to be in mor eof a suburban area but close enough to visit the city on like a weekly basis.,8.741
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_91.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_91.txt,Yeah I like -- I like the more quiet of the suburbuan -- not having to deal with too many things but to where I can still go and do things cuz I'm close enough to the city,8.68
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_92.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_92.txt,Um I know a lot of people that are up in that general area. Um I went on a trip to Europe a couple years ago -- I wanna say five now and so a lot of the people were actually from that far up north um and I -- I would say they were honestly a little bit different. Not in like a bad way but in a noticeable way to where it was like,20.375
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_93.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_93.txt,okay I can tell you're from more northern. They're more used to a different type of weather for one thing. It's a little bit colder out -- up there. It gets more humid too. Um it seems like more of a relaxed kind of area as well.,15.517
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_94.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_94.txt,so um it was a chance to go to the different countries. You could earn school credit and whatnot. I went just after my sophomore year in high school.,8.918
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_95.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_95.txt,Yeah so there were a lot of us like forty two I think from California that went.,6.158
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_96.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_96.txt,{LG} Um let's see. Where did I start at? Switzerland  Germany The Netherlands Belgium France and England I believe in that order.,16.067
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_97.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_97.txt,Not really. I hadn't had a chance to be that far away from home um and I ho- +honestly I had a blast. They kept us consistently going and going and going to where you didn't really have a chance to get homesick I felt like so it was it was an awesome experience. If I could do it again I definitely would.,18.802
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_98.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_98.txt,Um I can't speak to too many of them but I would definitely put the bay area as being more liberal. Um Sacramento itself I'd put a little bit more on the half and half.,11.759
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_99.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_99.txt,Um it -- it can vary honestly sometimes we're a little bit more liberal. Sometimes we're a little bit more conservative. Davis I'd put a little bit more liberal as well. Um let's see Santa Cruz area definitely a little bit more liberal in my opinion. Other than that I can't speak to the other ones too much.,21.042
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_100.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_100.txt,Um  I don't know. I think it depends. I would put like for example Mathur on the little bit more conservative side. It's a little bit more of an expensive area to live in um and higher class tend to be a little more on the conservative side so I'd put it that way. Like my boyfriend's family for example is very very repulican.,21.639
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_20_part_101.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_20_part_101.txt,Um so there's that. Um Rancho I'd put a little bit more liberal but again it kinda just depends on the area of Rancho. Um  Sacramento itself ag- +again is -- is definitely kind of more of a split but it -- it kind of depends on the area. Like south Sac I'd put more liberal -- downtown possibly more conservative.,24.711

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_21_part_7.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_21_part_7.txt,the north side of the town and the south side of the town {BR} and um when I was growing up that that it was pretty evident you know it's probably changed now but mhm,14.253
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_21_part_8.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_21_part_8.txt,{LS} because the north side of town has changed a lot I think they built some newer houses out there and shopping centers and that type of thing and I think it's probably nicer than it was when I grew up {BR} and that the the town has exploded in population since then too. We have a lot more people that live here. So it's just different.,19.49
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_21_part_9.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_21_part_9.txt,{LS} {BR} um well in a good way I know that the company E S R I has just exploded I don't know if you've heard of them but they're an international comp- +company company and they're based right here in Redlands which is incredible {BR} so they brought in a lot {BR} of people to work for them. um highly educated people from all over the world lots of foreigners {BR} so that's I think a great way our town has changed {BR},22.542
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_21_part_10.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_21_part_10.txt,um but uh but in you know in other ways it's just the population has exploded so it doesn't have quite the small town feel it used to {BR} and we used to {BR} be surrounded by orange groves and all of those have been cut down for shopping malls and all of that so it's changed a lot,19.431
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_21_part_11.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_21_part_11.txt,{LS} um {BR} {BR} you know that's a good question because w- we still will be in the supermarket and you see your kid's first grade teacher there and that kind of thing {BR} um but for one thing when I was in high school there was only one high school in all of Redlands {BR} so y- +you at one point in your life you went to school with everybody in town.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_20.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_20.txt,In high school? Um I did a lot of the basic stuff the other kids did. We -- you know my friends and I we would meet downtown a lot and,8.835
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_21.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_21.txt,go get pizza or something or hang out at each other's houses. Um I mean for hobbies I played the piano a lot. I did -- I went horseback riding so I did a little bit of this little bit of that. {LG},16.505

I mean you notice the difference especially even in Sacramento I notice how different of a world it is. It's um -- it's just a different way that people act. I don't know Davis just has a lot more it's a lot overall wealthier if you know you,20.889
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_23.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_23.txt,compare it to -- I mean Sacramento definitely has pockets of wealthy neighborhoods and that sort of thing but Davis overall the overall community is very well off and very well ecuated and Sacramento you get a -- a veral diverse you know you could meet people you're -- you're gonna encounter everybody everyday somebody who did not graduate from high school or even go to high school and then you'll meet somebody who has a P H D or something like that,24.065
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_24.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_24.txt,and I think it's actually very symbolic of -- of our uh state um -- the state government you know it's -- it's kinda like that.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_25.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_25.txt,so that's -- so that's why yeah that kind of all touches back on that whole reason why I really liked um you know having my high school set up the way it was was becuase I wasn't insulated the -- the whole time with all these other kids whose parents were well off and wealthy and,20.055
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_26.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_26.txt,you know whatever I was going to community college and meeting people that were struggling coming from these blue collar uh families in south Sacramento that sort of thing and um yeah it's -- it definitely made me a well I feel like it helped make me a well rounded person.,19.136

There's a lot more uh -- there seem to be more uh republicans and stuff in Davis now. {LG} I don't know if it has anything to do with the whole money thing. There's a lot of um the universities had a lot of developments in the last,21.583
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_35.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_35.txt,decade or so you know they had that new Mondavi Center built. They've had a -- just a serious you know flush of cash come their way,9.112

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_38.txt,with all kinds of problems of people being drunk in public and getting into fights and all kinds of -- oh it's terrible yeah I know they had -- they had a -- I had a friend who told me he was like yeah they I -- he said yeah he worked in the bar there downtown and he said there was some -- a group of people that came in on picnic day at six in the morning that ordered a pitcher of jack and coke. {LG},23.564
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_39.txt,I don't know if it's the wealthier students per say. I -- I just think that when -- I feel like they it seems like in some respects there doesn't -- there doesn't seem to be as many um um students who are really there to do research. I mean there definitely are. I'm not saying it's become this big party school or anything,22.537
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_40.txt,but it just seems like they're bringing in a lot more students who are maybe aren't so serious about studying but maybe only are getting in because they're wealthy and it makes sense. You know we have this um budget crisis going on and the schools aren't getting enough money so it makes sense why you would wanna try to maybe bring in students that have the cash to pay four units in full and not get financial aid or something like that so maybe that,23.931
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_41.txt,has something to do with it. Maybe -- maybe I'm just you know,5.249

They have dorms there but it's not very big. It's -- I don't know if it's just the way it was set up or the fact that Sacramento's already a big city and so it you know it can't really take on that college town atmosphere as much,22.479
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_54.txt,but it's um -- it's not a bad school. It has nice facilities. The administration can be a little bit of,7.18

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_58.txt,um I felt that I could get a little bit more mileage out of a journalism degree just simply because you have to learn some technical -- you know technicolo- +technological technical skills -- technological skills um you know I learned how to edit and,20.543
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_59.txt,I learned how to edit video and audio and upload that for viewers and I learned specific styles of writing and some really good proofreading and editing skills and how to do publication design layout so.,16.429
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_60.txt,Yeah and you know I learned a little bit about yeah updating websites and stuff like that so or at least on a web design platform you know word press and that sort of thing so I felt like I got a little bit more um useful -- usefulness out of that than going for a complit degree or something like that,20.739
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_61.txt,and the thing that I like about journalism is it's one of those jobs where you don't have those regular nine to five hours and you get to go different places and meet people and learn about issues so it's -- it's a good fit for me in that sense.,13.362

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_67.txt,Yeah but um I liked -- I -- I liked it. um The pay it was an interesting new set of skills that I got introduced to cuz a lot of people can do research on public records but not a lot of people know how to do legislative history research.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_82.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_82.txt,no there's no -- I mean there's no law you know as far being a belly dancer that says you know you have to pass this test before you can become one but um there are people who have their own copy righted formats you know they have American tribal style is also known as A T S is um --,20.148
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_83.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_83.txt,is copywritten and same with Amy Sigel's own format which is improve tribal style. It's an offshoot of A T S. Hers is also copywritten so if you wanna teach those formats -- those dance languages vocabularies and techniques you have to be certified in that,20.672
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_84.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_84.txt,um but as far as like a traditional style there's really no certification but it typically speaking if you wanna teach um dance especially in a like a dance fitness in a fitness facility something like that they -- most places are gonna want you to have um at least some kind of group fitness training,23.205
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_85.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_85.txt,so just so they just so they can see that you understand how to structure a group physical activity and go through a warm up and a cool down and that you're kinda familiar with how to struc- +structure structure everything but I had to go and actually get training um for,20.721
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_86.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_86.txt,And you're having to think -- you have to -- having to keep track of how many times you've done a certain movement or how many repetitions of that movement before you move on to the next one.,9.641
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_87.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_87.txt,Yeah it's a lot of work in that sense. I didn't realize it.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_145.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_145.txt,consider up until about somwhere around here like Novato  down here this is like the bay area. Novato is considered technically the very last,20.096
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_146.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_146.txt,I don't know why people consi- +consider I think it's because of the water because of the uh  um cuz the bay there. What's it called? The uh the cha- +channel not the channel it's um,15.499
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_147.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_147.txt,I think it has to do -- cuz there's a lot -- we have a lot of shipments we -- you know the port is you know Stockton has a port -- Sacramento has the -- we have a port in west Sacramento so we got a lot of shipments that actually come in via boat from the bay area and then they get stuff shipped up here um,17.862
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_148.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_148.txt,so I think it has to do really with -- with the water and the -- where the bay cuz it's not just when you come into the bay area from eighty it's not,10.011

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_152.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_152.txt,uh this year -- they're always trying to bring up some state of Jefferson thing or you get something on the ballot to secede or you know or split up the -- the whole state into multiple sections which would really be a bad idea for everybody because it's all interconnected like southern California needs us for the water and the food that we provide and we need southern California for the,25.008
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_153.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_153.txt,all the wealth that they bring in for -- from tourism and technology and all that innovation although we do get a lot of it from here too but it's all interconnected and I mean and really the area of Jefferson they need everyone else because they don't have a lot of industry up there outside of like,20.062
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_154.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_154.txt,but yeah the -- I'd say the people up in the mountains and stuff they're much more fiercely uh they're very autonomous -- very independent don't like to be told what to do More conservative -- not -- not necessarily republican maybe libertarian um so yeah you get those kind of libertarian people that are up here like in Humboldt and stuff and they're,21.18
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_155.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_155.txt,growing pounds of weed on their property and they have guns and stuff and but the -- and they don't believe in taxes but you know whatever theyv-- it's just,12.286
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_22_part_156.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_22_part_156.txt,Yeah um or at least that part you know it's one of those things where some people consider northern California like really up here.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_61.txt,because people really were hurt and our job is to screw 'em outta money.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_73.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_73.txt,just -- it's a big mass of people. There's lotta retirees mixed with families and kids -- mixed with people who's kids just moved out so everyone's kind of a in a different situation,10.703
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_74.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_74.txt,Um yeah we laugh about uh the -- the towns of Rockland and Roseville is where all the people that wanna live in bigger houses and kinda have the brand new schools they all flock up there so I have a lotta friends that moved up to Folton Roseville Rockland and Grant Bay and uh you -- it's -- they have ni- +nice it's nice to visit but you kinda have the,21.054
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_75.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_75.txt,feeling everyone's trying to be the same and (()) so it's not uh you know and then in the pocket -- and this is interesting there was actually an article about Kennedy High School where my daughter went where it was ranked as the most diverse high school in America,16.032
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_76.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_76.txt,to be fair since it is Sacramento still a good chunk of people that live here are employed by the state so we really you know we're united by that so this is still a working class state employment neighborhood so there's a lot -- you know there's a lot of diversity but it we're kinda united by that. And then midtown's got the younger hip,20.403
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_77.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_77.txt,flair which is nice and then where I grew up in kinda uh you know too -- too expensive to move into so there's a lotta older retired feel.,10.455
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_78.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_78.txt,The fabulous for- +forties yeah so it's just it -- you know I guess a lotta towns follow the same migration patterns so there's the downtown area and the rich people move up -- Riley what are you doing?  Okay you need something to eat?  Okay I'm just wondering. So um  so the -- you know you move the -- the wealthy people move out and build these nice homes and then they can move in and,22.975
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_79.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_79.txt,then it goes to further out suburbs so the fabulous forties were one of the earlier town -- uh wealthy neighborhoods that people moved into and this would be back when you still had a horse and buggy probably. I mean some of the houses are back in the eighteen -- early nineteen hundreds and so they built these big -- and it's where all the doctors and lawyers would live.,21.474
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_80.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_80.txt,Sam families yep but also that's kinda the address you wanna have I don't know if -- if you weren't gonna fly up to the hills you'd pick a big house fabulous forties.,9.809
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_81.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_81.txt,Yeah there's -- and but it's kinda neat like at Christmas they all decorate these streets so there'll be huge structures of streets with these elaborate Christmas decorations.,9.023
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_82.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_82.txt,Um it's uh not bad. It gets a little cold but not freezing It snows bout once every thirty years like maybe a ten minute flurry and uh other than that just kinda rai- +rainy rainy and brown and um but it's really -- it's -- it's a definitely um a three season,19.058
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_83.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_83.txt,and a beautiful spring which then gets hot and it turns kind of into fall and then it goes back to so there's no real winter. It's just rainy but you can -- like I ride by bike. I can ride twelve months out of the year at least one or two days um where I'm outside and it's sunny and there's nothing -- no moisture on the ground at all,22.668
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_84.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_84.txt,Yeah that's one of the biggest best features of Sacramento is our bike trail. Goes from Folsom Lake to dam they built um and it goes all the way to downtown and it should go down here but I don't know if you know the story here but in the pocket all those levies and rivers block away but all the land's private so there's a levy behind there that they could have a beautiful bike path on but that's supposedly private land even though they -- there's all kinds of easements cuz the levy has to be,26.919
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_85.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_85.txt,protected so the city and county can go up there and electrical companies go up there and federal government go up -- go up there and we all pay to protect the levees but we so there's a big um you know movement to try to open up the levees and then the bike trail could go all the way,16.739
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_86.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_86.txt,Yeah the pro- +(()) the homeowners still wanna -- like the cities even putting together money to buy out their -- their easement interest so it's a you can either move and we'll buy your house and we sell it or you can sell us your easement for this amount of money and  so that's what's going on.,16.397
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_87.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_87.txt,Yeah it's just one of -- I -- I think it's kinda sad because if you look at big towns that have spent public money to build an arena a lotta times it doesn't work out and Seattle would be the biggest example. Um and -- and Sacramento um has always been uh kind of a wanna be town I guess. We wanna be like L A and (()) like San Francisco like -- now it's like Oregon. Now we wanna be like Portland,22.685
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_88.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_88.txt,but it -- it -- I mean we don't really have the kind of market that can support a big N B A franchise. It's kinda sad so we're never gonna be able to compete at a playoff level. We did in a certain period of time like the year two thousand but basketball's changed a lot since then so we put in this new arena's gonna cost half a million dollars. The city put up three hundred million.,23.692
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_89.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_89.txt,Just seems like there's other issues we could put our money for and supposedly that's gonna stimulate the economy but like I was telling before in ninety-two the city helped bring in this Sacramento Live and it turned out to be a huge flop and then that turned into something called the downtown plaza which was kinda nice to have a mall there but then the same company bought the Roseville Mall and,22.47
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_90.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_90.txt,sacrificed the downtown mall so that Roseville Mall would flourish so,5.947
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_91.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_91.txt,close out and then they say oh this'll be a great place for an arena so it just doesn't -- you know,5.764
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_92.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_92.txt,Yeah and you get our ba- +basketball our mayor's a big basketball fan and so he was instrumental in getting the team to stay but it's just kinda nuts.,7.474
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_93.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_93.txt,Well the owners there were trying to they were having financial problems and they uh wanted to sell. I don't know if you heard about L A but owner got in trouble for making terrible comments. His wife got control of the team and they sold it to a guy from Washington the Microsoft guy for two billion dollars so this is what the guys in Sacramento were trying to do. They were courting that same group and saying we'll sell you our team back then it was gonna be for like a billion dollars,28.426
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_94.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_94.txt,and uh they were interested and the mayor got involved and said don't do it so the M B A denied the sale and said Sacramento's trying to do all it can but the unwritten message was you better build a new arena or you're gonna lose that team so then they got two years to try to rebuild the arena.,20.968
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_95.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_95.txt,Yeah the -- the -- the and this is how the Kings got here. The big -- well the big issues are um what do we wanna be? What's gonna be our future? Is it gonna be a big city or is it a nice outdoor town where it's a great place to raise kids so that's been a debate and it's driven by developers and like we were talking about the developers have had their way with the city for years and built,20.747
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_96.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_96.txt,tons of buildings and they collapse cuz there's not enough people to buy 'em and then investors buy 'em and they rent 'em out and gradually the population increases and then it crashes again so it's always been this tug of war with developers. That's how the basketball ball team got here in the first place. We had this big swatch of farmland called Natomas and the developers wanted to build and,20.67
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_97.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_97.txt,Sacramento and the guy whose mill it was Sutter said you guys shouldn't build in Sacramento because it floods all the time but one of the developers said oh I'm gonna build this town so he did and then it kept flooding and they finally lifted the whole town up in the eighteen fifties and then gradually started building the levee system,20.01
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_98.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_98.txt,and still Natomas was one of the things they said was we're gonna build these flood plains so that when the floods come the levees will protect the city and we'll just blow out the land so it goes in this funnel so Natomas was one of those areas. The developers said hey look at all this land right north of Sacramento. Let's build there and city said you can't so they said how bout we bring in an N B A team?,22.28
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_99.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_99.txt,Will you rezone for us? So they did so that's how the Kings got here and then uh couple years back the department of (()) it's called the corps of engineers the federal government said you guys are crazy. You can't build here and they made 'em put hundreds of millions of dollars into building the levees and so those developers long gone and they made all their money and then the rest of people have to kick in,23.528
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_100.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_100.txt,then the three hundred million built a new arena for the new ba- +basketball you know cuz the baasketball team (()) so yeah that's always been the tension in Sacramento is the developers wanna keep building and that -- a lot of people say not so fast let's wait for the growth to come first before building and the developers wanna do it the other way. If we build people will show up.,22.048
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_101.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_101.txt,I don't know where they come from to be honest. That's a good question um because southern California seems to be booming too so I think a lotta people come from outta state. Yeah I think a lot of people wanna come to California cuz of the weather. ,14.182
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_102.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_102.txt,But at -- there's a you know I think we have terrible unemployment problems so there's not jobs right now especially in the central valley which is a little different a- +area area,9.878
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_103.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_103.txt,No is -- it -- I mean you're totally right it's cra- +crazy it's -- it's crazy if you look at the population center that's there it's almost like forgot it's like in this legislature they almost have no voice. Nobody stops by I mean it's really an interesting --,14.545
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_104.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_104.txt,I mean it's unbelievable. There's a pr- +(()) I used to -- when I first started where I work which is at the attorney general's office before I got back into securities law I -- they made me work for a year in prison law because when prisoners sue um the prison guards get represented by the attorney general so every prison has a ve- +very has a very active,21.11
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_105.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_105.txt,So I remember getting this case in Susanville. There's a big prison in Susanville and I'd never been there and I was really excited so you basically go to Reno and take a left and you drive up the three ninety-five freeway which goes all the way to Oregon and I'd never been there in my life. I mean I'd been around most of the country but I'd never been up past Susanville and you just think there's this huge road that goes all the way through the state hundreds of miles I think it was three hundred miles to the Oregon border,24.431
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_106.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_106.txt,and I did not know a thing never been there -- never saw it and then the five is the same way. Three ninety-five parallels five and like you go past Redding then you've got a whole nother huge swatch of land and there's nothing going on.,13.988
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_107.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_107.txt,Well um I laugh because um in -- in my job when I was working in corporations we would sue these um entities that were doing securities fraud which is ripping people off financially. It was pretty broad definition so we had a ton of activity in the central valley and a ton up north,21.384
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_108.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_108.txt,where these guys would pretty much rip off their neighbors and then you go up there and they go you can't -- you're the government. You can't -- you have no jurisdiction over me I'mmy own thing and and my friend um ended up getting sued by not the -- ci- +city not the Jefferson but a whole different one. These guys had made up their own country declared their independence said they had their own supreme court and they ended up suing us,23.96
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_109.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_109.txt,in their court for uh trying to sue them. I mean it was just kinda nuts so yeah there's kinda this free for all mentality let me just do whatever I want and uh nobody can tell me what to do. I don't know.,14.166
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_110.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_110.txt,So that was it I did the security -- I did the insurance defense for a year -- went into securities law and then um I wanted to move from the department of corporations which is a pretty small agency to attorney general which is big so they said okay do this for a year and then get back into security so other than that one year time I've been doing the security.,20.136
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_111.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_111.txt,It was fun. I mean it really was fun because again I got a lot of trial -- I didn't go to trial per say but I did everything up to trial um so I go- +got it was really fun to get that trial background and then um had a very diverse case load and got to visit prisons but after about a year I'm like okay that's good. Let's go back to business stuff yeah.,20.321
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_112.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_112.txt,Um yeah there was some fun -- I mean not fun for the victims but yeah there -- there was uh a good -- I call them the good old boy network but these guys were insurance agents and they sold insurance policies and probably made forty thousand and they decided well if we sold these investments we could make a lot more so there was actually,22.513
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_113.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_113.txt,two promoters that would go gather up all these insurance guys. One of 'em told me yeah we used to meet at Foster's Freeze and say tell your customers that in addition to insurance products you can make a lotta money by and then they would just sell them a lotta A T M machines fields of (()) beans and just any -- whatever you could think of they would just tell it and these,23.768
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_114.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_114.txt,poor little far- +farmers it was crazy cuz you'd meet these farmers. They were super humble um but you know lived in these big farms but not elaborate and then they'd show you their financial stuff. They'd go I think this guy ripped me off and it -- would've put three hundred thousand dollars on it. I mean it was like crazy so yeah they had tons of cash,22.125
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_115.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_115.txt,so one of the -- yeah one of the ones I remember was the guy was actually from L A sent his guys up to the central valley and he -- his son played footall so he built an arena for this high school -- this is a public high school with his name on it so all these poor investors lost all their money so that this football arena could be built in the name of the guy's,22.038
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_116.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_116.txt,Um there's the good old developer network It -- I mean first there's the politicians which I don't really understand. I mean even though I work for the government the politician thing is crazy and their -- they know a lot ore about it but in Sacramento we have a lot of developers and um there is very tight knit and they own a lot of land and they then will lobby the government to let them,22.382
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_117.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_117.txt,open up by zoning in a certain way so they can sell -- and they own it for years. I mean some of this land's been held for fifty years already and there's just waiting for -- so there's some really tight families that own a lot and have a lot of control.,13.611
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_118.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_118.txt,Mhm but the -- anybody. I mean they're -- they're -- ost of them are democratic but they will give money to anybody that's gonna help 'em out yeah.,8.307
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_119.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_119.txt,Yeah the city council votes on all that stuff like employment of city uh people and uh city salaries and fire and police,8.616
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_120.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_120.txt,the proposal is let's give the mayor a lot more power so stuff can happen a lot faster,5.96
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_121.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_121.txt,Well I laugh because um our mayor is a really good mayor to a certain extent I mean he has his issues but that guy up in Toronto the Tom Ford guy he's -- he's a strong mayor so it -- it's great is your mayor's good but if your mayor's terrible it can cause a lot of problems and the developers are the ones who are gonna benefit. In fact that's why I'm laughing because,22.521
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_122.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_122.txt,one of these developers just was put in the papers. He had donated a hundred thousand dollars the strong American (()) so you just know they're just waiting for this to happen and then you're gonna see a lot more of this stuff going on where they do more Natomas's type let's zone this in a certain way.,18.692
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_123.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_123.txt,Yeah so behind the scenes people out there know way more about what's gonna happen than the average fellow and then if the average voter goes along with it then you go wow I didn't know that was gonna happen.,11.148
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_124.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_124.txt,Yeah there -- it's hard to inform every -- yeah in Sacramento everyone's kinda got their own interests and it's not on the radar (()) kinda yeah.,7.889
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_125.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_125.txt,Yeah the -- I mean it was ki- +kinda I felt yeah it was almost a guilted feeling because I work for the state so nothing happened. I mean we got furlow which means we got a five percent pay cut but at the same time I had a job and all my benefits and nothing changed so the whole time kinda laid low (()) {LG} cuz there was a lotta anti-government sentiment but,21.548
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_126.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_126.txt,from -- that -- that's the work perspective but the bigger issue for me is I do securities fraud which yeah I mean it was awful because first um  for years the defense industry -- the security defenders have said the government regulation's too tight. We need to have less rules and less rules,23.727
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_127.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_127.txt,and so the guys on my end the regulators are like this is crazy these guys have too much power. They they can do all this stuff so we're just waiting for something bad to happen and then the other thing is is that here's -- all these people are trying to advocate these tax cuts and in my opinion a tax cut just means more cash and everybody knows cash just wants to make a return so you have to invest in something so that's what causes these bubbles,23.225
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_128.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_128.txt,so you could just tell that something was gonna happen so then when it did um the first thing the businesses said is don't change any regulations and they spent all their lobbying effort not to change any so ac- +(()) basically no rules have changed and then they um skated outta that then they started paying all these fines,21.203
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_129.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_129.txt,which is we're part of. We negotiated with a lot of banks to pay off the (()) and then I just read in the Economist magazine they showed a picture of a cartoon of a company holding a -- you know a mug shot picture and saying you know American business is being criminalized and you just laugh. It's like okay so nothing changed.,21.626
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_130.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_130.txt,The -- they just pay these fines and then everything can still happen again so it's kinda like we had a chance to change something but it really didn't do much.,7.615
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_131.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_131.txt,Well I mean going back there was and if -- when I went to economics um that we talked about the glass steagall act which after our last depression the -- they said okay one way to stop it is to separate banks from insurance companies. Banks should be in the business of lending money and securities company should be in business of taking on a risk so banks risks should be tied to its collateral so,20.966
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_132.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_132.txt,when I was in college in eighty-three I had a professor who said companies trying to appeal that but when it happens it's gonna be a nightmare so I member -- always remember that. Well they finally repealed it under the ninety-four congress when it was all and then the -- they just went to town so now you create a situation where the bank will create a loan instrument which in the past meant they were obligated,23.6
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_133.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_133.txt,to you know keep it safe so if someone was gonna build a house you'd say let me see your job applications let me see what the house is worth and all that stuff so now the banks said what we're gonna do we're gonna turn around and bundle that and sell it as a security to investors so we don't have any of that risk so we can,20.494
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_134.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_134.txt,we don't care if the guy has a job. I mean we're just gonna say it's worth a hundred grand the house prices going up. Gonna bottle up and pass that risk onto someone else so that's what was predicted would happen afte glass steagall act separated. That's what did happen. I mean there -- if you read economic magazines they'll tell you oh it's not really because because of that but (()) it seems,20.147
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_135.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_135.txt,pretty much what happened so that -- I mean that's one thing you can do is separate the risk. Keep the risk with the loan you know? (()) And then the other ones is like I'm saying is the- +these you have these cash (()) and people think tax breaks are great but all they do is create more cash so um I think as a society you need to say hey listen we -- you may not like government. Government has a right to decide,24.242
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_136.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_136.txt,whether you make cows or butter. That's you learn in economics so why don't we put the money to a better use as a society rather than rather than just letting people speculate how they're gonna use it all in these big bubbles so,12.315
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_137.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_137.txt,Um yes Sacramento was hit um particularly hard um  because a lot of California and Sacramento's um economy was based on the housing so Sacramento was bein gdeveloped from that ninety-two period on. Once that kinda died out in ninety-,20.35
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_138.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_138.txt,I bet the (()) five years just starting to pick up so let's say ninety-six to ninety-seven through two thousand seven is aten year boom of just building and building homes and it attract a lotta people that came in to work in that industry and they're building all these neighborhoods up in the hills in Elk Grove and it just exploded,21.065
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_139.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_139.txt,and then what that crashed all that went away so a lotta people in that industry was gone. Uh the government propped it up a little bit but um because of those furlows I told you about the government -- a lot of the disposable income was gone so people still had their jobs. They could still afford a home and they could afford a car and they could afford,22.496
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_140.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_140.txt,you know to go to work but they didn't have any money to go out to lunch so a lot of the restaurants started going out to business.,7.059
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_141.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_141.txt,Mhm so that was sad but like I said it ne- +never didn't really affect us so I mean like you're right I didn't get to go out to lunch so I helped tank a lotta restaurants but I mean eventually it started to pick back up.,13.351
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_142.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_142.txt,Um I -- yeah you notice it a it -- it just -- nothing tangible but you just get a feeling. More people at the shop Oh you know what's -- this is crazy -- I don't know if it um if it we- +(()) I heard it was almost recession (()) but one of the things for us is a couple years ago we went to Disneyland and it was like the most crowded I've ever seen in my entire life so I'm thinking wow I mean the economy most be doing better because everyone can afford to go to Disneyland.,24.26
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_143.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_143.txt,Yeah just the feeling like and the -- and the -- when we read that Time Magazine article we knew if you lived in California that the rest of the country thought that but if you lived in California you've always been optimistic. That's part of what it was (()). It's like two thousand eight was the first time I ever felt collectively that there was not optimism,23.694
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_144.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_144.txt,and that was scary. but it i- +is another thing that's weird is my wife where's she's from is turned into like hte playground of the rich and fa- +famous it's called Manhattan Beach and so you go there and it's funny cuz all these guys are all doing great and they continue to do great. In fact they did even better during the recession. But everyone's angry and it was weird,22.909
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_145.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_145.txt,They -- they're all you know turning into these too much government you know too -- so it's weird. It's like oh my gosh you gusy have everything so that's another difference. It's like people used to be optimistic and they used to be happy living here but now the optimism seems to have gone away a lot and so is the happiness so that's kinda different too,20.951
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_146.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_146.txt,Um to be honest I'd love to move back to the beach. My wife's brother lives in a town called Carpenteria. My wife and I would love to move there but I don't know how realistic that is but it's a goal.,12.164
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_147.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_147.txt,No we're -- that's what we're working on college applications and all that so yeah you just apply to as many as you can and see what happens yeah.,6.645
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_148.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_148.txt,I think so. I think most of the ones she's picked are yeah,5.194
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_149.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_149.txt, yeah because I don't know one of the things is coastal right? So there's a huge difference even if you look at San Luis Obispo which is this way to Bakersfield (()) is I have this southern state,20.517
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_150.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_150.txt,which is its own animal and then I'd have the coastal state which goes (()) like that and there's a northern coast and a southern coast and the northern coast ends right there. I mean the southern -- this is the southern coast.,17.096
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_151.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_151.txt,It just di- +didn't it -- no one knows what its like there. I -- most people in California have no idea what goes on. In fact there was a world famous book about it,7.203
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_152.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_152.txt,Yeah and so that would this -- and s- +so so then you got the -- this is the southern coast region and even there there's a big difference between San Diego and Santa Barbara but at least they're on similar wave lengths and then here's the northern coast. Northern co- +coast or central coast because the northern coast is too -- I'll tell you the difference. I love -- this is surf country,22.835
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_153.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_153.txt,all the way up here and you get to here and if you're driving in a car you'll be listening to you know regular radio stations and youget to here and everything becomes a reggae station,11.5
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_154.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_154.txt,That is the big difference cuz um -- so there's northern coast and then um see this is my kinda bias -- okay then my mother in law lived in the eastern sierras and that's mono cali and so um there's a mountain range here which you know divides,21.42
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_155.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_155.txt,There -- it's -- it's just an amazing town so you -- three ninety-five actually goes all the way through the state down San Diego and if you're um on this side of the mountains uh it's a totally different world than on this side so I really like it over here so this is be like the eastern sierras and the sierras since they run from,22.273
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_156.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_156.txt,Mexico all the way up to Canada that's a pretty big swatch of that area too so that goes all the way up here and then {LG} you've got -- this is the central valley and that's gonna go up to right about Sacramento and then um you have this uh,21.533
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_157.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_157.txt,cool swatch of -- yeah that's still northern coast and then Sacramento um is kind of on the cusp -- we're not really central valley and we're not really San Francisco although we wanna be so um it's almost like its own little animal and cuz of the politics and I guess Redding and Chico are gonna be just like the northern central valley all that cuz they're about the same.,27.266
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_158.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_158.txt,Uh  or you mentioned Portland too. Yeah I mean but -- but it's more -- I guess it's more there's a bigger thing. If you live in Fresno like you were saying you don't have much representation in the capital. Sacramento does and you have representation. YOu have representation in L A and San Francisco. Those are the three biggest areas that you could say I'm getting taken care of and this -- so this area I think is pretty unique. I mean,23.1
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_159.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_159.txt,it's Sacramento's the capital and it gets the benefits from that um so we're not really (()) we have great agriculture in this area which I think that if you're a farmer you're gonna relate to those people but I think the reality is you're much better taken care of if you live here than if you live down here. Yeah so yeah it's -- it's an amazing state.,21.865
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_160.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_160.txt,Um I think -- yeah I think the coastal way of difference is what I was talking about before. Optimistic and happy I re- +really I mean I do and I think here it is more like you know if you're from the midwest you're gonna fit in a lot more (()) it's like my mom's (()) I mean you were just -- life is tough and you sacrificed and family was everythin and just you know a different feeling and I think a lotta people escape from that,28.555
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_161.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_161.txt,and wanna be here and a lotta people love thisand they wanna stay insulated and everything so I think -- think California's great cuz you can find people that feel the same way as you do but as you go up and down the caost that's where you find ust a very optimistic not free spirited I guess so much but more just like,20.481
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_162.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_162.txt,um happier -- or used to be that way like I said it's changed so much but anywhere you drive along here and you stop in these towns it's just nice vibe.,8.446
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_163.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_163.txt,Yeah I mean we're obviously not thebeach so we don't really fit in um the thing about Sacramento that I learned that I didn't know when I was younger -- oops um is that uh Sacramento's got a lot going on its own you know? I mean it has great outdoor activities. It's close to Tahoe it's close to San Francisco,24.132
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_164.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_164.txt,um and it just -- it's got its own vibe that's gotta turn it into its own (()) thing and people are just starting to realize that so --,8.524
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_165.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_165.txt,but I mean just couple things. I -- takes me twenty minutes to get to work and I don't get on a freeway. I love that. At lunch I ride on a bike trail and I could go as long as I want I mean I could go ffity mile ride if I wanted to and never see a car I mean that's just the kinda stuff and when we're out there I see dozens of people that are out there doing the same thing I see coyotes turkeys,20.434
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_166.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_166.txt,um foxes just um- +unbelievable um deer and I can do that every day at lunch and then get back in my building and I'm on the fifteenth floor looking out and then I get backin and drive twenty minutes home. I know my kids are within walking distance to their school and they're going to great schools and then if I wanted to I could go out to a great meal in midtown and,22.087
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_167.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_167.txt,(()) I would say the line was right see Monterey's definitely nor cal. Fresno's definitely not,8.163
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_168.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_168.txt,Compared to the southern. I mean you're right on the border but this is like at San Maria out here where they invented the tri tip steak you know and Ronald Reagan has his little ranch so this is north so yeah it's gotta be here but Fresno and Bakersfield they um have alot more in common than um San Luis Obispo and L A so it would be kinda like,22.965
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_169.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_169.txt,Yeah just um it would be j- +just a lot of it would be climate you know you can seriously be outside three hundred thirty days out of the year without any rain. B- +beautiful beautiful weather um and sunny and then you start getting up here and you start getting into the winter uh,21.954
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_170.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_170.txt,and that kinda stuff and then uh the clothes get down here at least on the coast and people are flashier and whereas I get up here and they're more into their earthy kinda stuff.,12.985
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_171.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_171.txt,Mkay so you have your San Diego accent and uh I don't even know how to describe it but um you have a lotta military guys down there so it was more of a melting pot feel and then L A when I moved there I just thought everyone in L A sounded pretty much the same as the people in Sacramento but the people of Sacramento think,20.672
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_23_part_172.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_23_part_172.txt,Um I say Sacramento you know and they think of it as the cow town cuz the L A Kings -- I mean the L A Lakers and the Sacramento Kings are rivals so they call us the cow town   ,26.301

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_1.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_1.txt,It's north about ten to fifteen minutes He taught there for about thirty-seven years when he retired and both my brother and I went there and my mom was a teacher as well but she stopped teaching to have a family years ago so yeah.,16.95
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_2.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_2.txt,I have one brother who lives in San Diego. If we're lucky he gets up here about once every five years. [laughter],5.709
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_3.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_3.txt,No it's just seems like everybody's kind of busy and the traveling. He has a family down there and so it is a long ways and it is expensive especially if you're taking you know like four people or so. So,14.821
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_4.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_4.txt,Um It was funny cuz when we were younger even my parents said we were more like only children because there was such an age difference and even my parents there's ten years different between their siblings. Both my parents are the oldest in their familes,13.59
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_5.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_5.txt,And there's ten years with them as well and I have two children and there's six years difference between them so it just kinda seems like [laughter] it kinda runs in the family,11.083
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_6.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_6.txt,not really we actually weren't that close um growing up just because we were doing different things different stages of life um we're actually a lot closer know which is nice. I'm very thankful even though we're so far apart. But you know we'll talk some times on the fun or email and so it's nice to have that connection so,20.53
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_7.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_7.txt,Um in grammar school through probably about junior high I had a group of kids there were two or three of them in the neighborhood that we kinda hung out together. We actually um had a um lip synch group that we did for about a year and a half and we went around and performed,18.381
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_8.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_8.txt,Um it was like pop pop pop rock whatever was current for the time and um you know we'd perform at like events at the Moose Lodge or the Elk's or you know different little things It was fun.,12.605
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_9.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_9.txt,Um the Elk's I believe are both the Moose um is primarily men and then both of them have like subsidiaries that there's you know like the women of the Moose or whatever and there's probably the women of the Elk as well,17.575
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_10.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_10.txt,Um the Moose from what I've seen has slowed down a lot at least in this area um but it's I know it's at least state-wide and probably even national and then Elk's I believe is the same. It's um you know there's a lot of those types of organizations,20.06
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_11.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_11.txt,My dad joined the Moose later on uh to kinda get a social thing but then never really got involved with it my mom um has belonged for forty-something years to a philanthropic organization called beta sigma phi and it's world-wide.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_12.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_12.txt,uh just because I have so much going on in my life right now I don't have time to be active in it but I was very active for about ten years and I held numerous positions and offices and so yeah we do fundraising and different events.,15.906

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_21.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_21.txt,And um I love the area but the Bay Area is much more expensive and so there was no way for me to stay down there by myself. And I didn't know anybody down there even though I had a job. It just was kinda pointless for me to stay down there but but I've I always love the ocean so I try to get to the ocean as much as I can,23.643
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_22.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_22.txt,My grandfather had property over in Trinidad Oh s- really right on the ocean,6.201

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_24.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_24.txt,Um I not great lengths of time but go there very frequently And uh even though my grandfather's gone I still try to get over there at least once a year. It's just a great place to just go and enjoy fog and cool and slower life. Yes.,22.478
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_25.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_25.txt,Um in this area specifically one of the biggest ones is the um promenade down here. It used to be the original downtown mall As I was telling one of your uh co-parts [laughter] when they were in the other day um like when I was younger in the mall,20.486
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_26.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_26.txt,to me there were interesting structural things in it that you know kids could climb on and poles and,6.276
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_27.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_27.txt,Yes Okay. Yes and the stores were very very unique um it wasn't so much of the glass fronts like you see now in the Mount Shasta Mall Um even the Mount Shasta Mall was a lot different it just more uniqueness to the stores there was one store um that,21.785
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_28.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_28.txt,and it'd be great cuz you'd walk by and they'd have them set up that they were like automatically playing and so when you'd go down that section of the mall you'd hear them,6.501
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_29.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_29.txt,The Mount Shasta Mall over on Hilltop. and uh there was another store I think it was a bath supply type place or something and they had designed it that to walk into the store you actually walked over like a little wood bridge to go into it and there was just uniqueness. There was a a burger place that the whole front of it,21.883
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_30.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_30.txt,were these little saddles that the kids loved to sit on with their families when they were having burgers yeah just things like that that you remember it's it's not so commercialized and you know box stores and chain stores and you know I'm sorry my kids are never gonna get to see that you know and you know and I,21.65

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_36.txt,I don't know um a lot of that would depend on his dad if his dad would agree to it um I imagine maybe within a few years he'll have one but he'll have one of the kid phones you know that only have maybe three numbers or four numbers in them,15.768
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_37.txt,So that way they can't you know run up phone bills or whatever if they only have designated people they're allowed to call.,5.836
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_38.txt,Yeah and I've even seen some of the kids at his school that have them and it's just like wow [laughter] That's just crazy to think little you know eight nine-year-olds or whatever running around with them so Yeah it's pretty hard to [inaudible],16.59
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_39.txt,you know so I I wouldn't trade the time with family for anything you know I'm I'm very thankful that I grew up with grandparents great grandmother great aunts and uncles things like that that I'm really really miss that aren't around anymore,15.932
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_40.txt,now and even my kids don't really have that and my dad passed away almost three years ago and um my daughter was about eight months when he passed away so she doesn't you know really know him my son remembers him you know and we're actually living with my mom right now,22.165
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_41.txt,Yeah so that's good so at least we're keeping those generations together and so yeah Um as far as people are concerned I think there's been some changes I think with the progress of technology and,21.694
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_42.txt,the economy and everything I think people are just on the go so much more now that they don't necessarily stop and slow down My two genres of music are pretty much eighties and country,17.678
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_43.txt,"And you know everybody's like ""Oh country it's all twangy"" Ah it's really not. It's the older stuff that was more twangy. A lot of the country music now to me you know they're story telling Yeah I'm",13.205
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_44.txt,you know and my mom when I was growing up she listened to a lot of um folk music uh-huh My aunt and uncle actually are folk performers that have traveled Wh- uh-uh And um so I'm very thankful I've had music around me a lot of broad spectrum of music,20.105
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_45.txt,um and then you know I find it funny that I end up in the Arts Council My aunt thought that was funny too,5.658
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_46.txt,Well it's funny in kind of exciting at the same way Um but I love it here it's the best job I've had ever I mean it's you know it's been crazy the last few weeks getting ready for this event but [laughter] and we have more going tonight to so,15.741
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_47.txt,but um the people are great the job is great I get to meet a lot of people. I know there's going to be a lot more that I'll be meeting. Um So it's just it's great so but you know,17.262
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_48.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_48.txt,Uh-huh Or are folk musicians They are they've kind of stopped performing um Mm-hm. They both have full-time job well He's retired now. He's been retired for about two years Um and she's getting ready to retire in October early um that just kind of happened but they're likley can't pass it up. They do a lot of traveling.,21.135
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_49.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_49.txt,Um They actually I've only seen them perform once Um and it actually was really exciting because my parents happened to be on like a cruise or something when my aunt and uncle happened to come through and they were perf- orming up at Siskiyou College up in Mount Shasta.,20.889
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_50.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_50.txt,And uh so my son and I and my son was just a few months old we traveled up there and spent the night and everything. And we got to see him perform in the uh performance hall up at the college and it it was really excited,11.821
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_51.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_51.txt,Mm-hm. [tongue click] Yeah. Um [typing] Um [typing],13.411
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_52.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_52.txt,Um do a lot of uh uh Celtic and Scottish and Irish it's the heritage,7.5
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_53.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_53.txt,And so luckily she sent me her agenda where they were going to be for the week and Um and I was just like are you guys gonna make it home? [laughter] with everything but they did but she and I are very very close um She's more like an older sister,18.94
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_54.txt,which is nice. So you're you're ancestry's Ir- Irish and then Um I actually personally am adopted,10.202
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_55.txt,Um but from what I've been told my um roots are French-Irish [tongue click] um but my parents my adoptive parents there's Irish Scottish probably some Welsh that general area where a lot of people seem,23.598
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_56.txt,and with everything else on my plate right now it's like uh that's gonna have to go on the back burner for now but I know like on my dad's side he's got uh great-grandfather that was in the Civil War and he was actually pretty high up in command,15.561
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_57.txt,Uh we have some stuff from him and which is kinda nice it's it's really kinda cool to see these very old letters from like the eighteen hundreds,10.97
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_58.txt,[tongue click] They're from um my dad's great-grandfather and they would've been to I believe either his wife or his parents and then luckily have kind of come down through the generations and um,19.505
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_59.txt,Um and [tongue click] that's where I went to school all through there with the exception of freshman year cuz the school's were done a little different back then. actually it was kinda nice because school I did um K through fourth at one,17.373
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_60.txt,fifth and sixth at one seventh eighth at one ninth here in Redding,5.037
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_61.txt,Yes. Yeah which was kinda neat because you kinda got great I actually knew a lot of the kids in the class ahead of me and the class behind me. and but at the same time it was kinda neat freshman to just go off by yourself and you're meeting all these kids from all the other areas,17.029
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_62.txt,but it was kinda sad too because then you went back to your areas and you kinda lost contact with them So yeah,6.066
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_63.txt,So but I liked it. I I liked the way it was broken up it kinda it gave you a nice break. I mean like my son now his school he started at Kindergarten he'll be there through eighth grade and then he'll go to high school,12.256
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_64.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_64.txt,He probably will um because of the district he's in he probably will go to Enterprsie. Okay. So but between my mom's philanthropic group and my dad being a teacher I always felt like I was more comfortable around adults,17.256
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_65.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_65.txt,Um well because like I'd be over there sometimes with him um I gu- I mean I knew like all the teachers when I started school,7.935
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_66.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_66.txt,And uh so I know a lot of people in that and which was nice because when I did join it wasn't like walking into this new thing where you don't know anybody you already knew,10.835
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_67.txt,Yeah So I don't know I actually have my twenty year high school reunion next summer,7.395
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_68.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_68.txt,I my first husband and I were going through some stuff and separating and I was pregnant and I just was not not in the place or frame of mind to go do it,13.112
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_69.txt,So and I think we probably will have a bigger turnout this time for the twenty-year which I've heard usually at twenty years there's more people than a ten-year So,8.85
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_70.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_70.txt,Um I've connected with some of them on Facebook which is nice. Um there are some um some have moved on in other directions but some of the ones even that have moved away are claiming they're coming so that'll be nice too and uh and again I'm you know connected with some of the people before and after my class,22.397
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_71.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_71.txt,So and I thin- I think a lot people uh especially like the class ahead of me kind of linked up with me in some ways because my dad was a teacher,12.606
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_72.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_72.txt,and I you know I can remember cuz I did a lot of the grading for my dad stuff [laughter] Yeah.,7.245
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_73.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_73.txt,Yeah. and uh but I guess that's a pretty common thing because there was someone in my class um both his parents taught at the high school his dad did math his mom did English and typing and uh and I know he wasn't real fond of math and so there seems to be apparently this stereotype that,21.795
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_74.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_74.txt,you know like okay if your parents do one subject that's gonna be your best subject and it's like no [laughter],7.478
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_75.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_75.txt,"So but yeah I used to have people say ""Hey can you get me a copy of the test?"" or ""What are the answers on this?"" and it's like ""No. I can't."" And you know and a lot of it was it wasn't so much you know not that I would've done it anyways but it wasn't so much me being s- stubborn and you know just being a jerk about it it was you know a lot of times he made em up like",21.784
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_76.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_76.txt,"Exactly you know and they're like ""Oh he'll just use the same for"" I'm like ""He never uses the same stuff"" You know anybody who thought that he had file cabinets full of stuff it's like ""No.""",12.119
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_77.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_77.txt,He did until the last few years because the district changed,5.184
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_78.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_78.txt,Um when he started teaching up until I don't know roughly seven years before he retired all the high schools in this area were one district and when Central Valley became the city of Shasta Lake it became incorporated they thought it was ridiculous to have their high school part of of Redding,20.284
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_79.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_79.txt,So and and also you've got high school policies and procedures you know where they may have a monthly staff meeting and you know there are different ways of doing things and then you've got grammar school where especially now I see it with my son's school it seems like every other week they've got minimum days they've got meetings they've got this they've got this they've got this,21.158
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_80.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_80.txt,to keep the bus schedules the same the high school had to do that as well. So the uh procedures and protocol changed and you know after somebody who's been teaching for thirty-something years that's that's a big change,18.494
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_81.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_81.txt,Yeah it's it's different I mean there's there's different little areas and stuff um I mean like Redding's the main city you know you've got areas where. Go ahead Ryan [laughter] Um but you know like you've got the Enterprise area over here and you've got Buckeye up here Um yeah you have the City of Shasta Lake would be probably about right here,22.837
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_82.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_82.txt,um and then over so you know further down you've got Anderson Mm-hm Um [tongue click] so yeah all all the high schools from this whole area originally were in one district Okay. And then yeah when Shasta Lake changed uh,21.248
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_83.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_83.txt,[tongue click] Yeah. Yeah. So and that you know and that was a big change too I remember for a lot of the teachers again because I knew a lot of them I mean kinda overhear things and um there were a lot of weighings back and forth as to do you want to share with the Shasta Union high school district,22.479
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_84.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_84.txt,or do you want to go to this new Gateway district and many of the teachers from out here stayed out here. Um because I re- I remember overhearing my parents when all of this was going on cuz this you know was for months they you know knew this was happening,21.471
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_85.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_85.txt,"and this district was saying ""okay well we'll give you this and we'll promise you this and blah blah blah blah blah"" This district wasn't saying a whole lot or vice- I it mighta been vice-versa Um but then once the decisions were made",20.799
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_86.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_86.txt,then information came out and it was kind of like in many ways it would've been better,5.963
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_87.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_87.txt,to go here. So but you know I think at the same time figured [sigh] I don't have too many more years hopefully that I'd be working before I retire and he did actually retire early um,20.015
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_88.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_88.txt,[tongue click] The uh high school's only about two minutes from our house when it snowed that was convenient because the hill we live on if it snows you don't drive it's it's very steep it's got a steep driveway and then a steep hill so if you try to drive on it you basically go down backwards so you,21.762
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_89.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_89.txt,you walk if you have to go anywhere and there were times I remember him you know walking to school and,6.224
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_90.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_90.txt,"Oh yeah usually usually but that was the thing too that was kinda crazy when there was just the first district it wasn't uncommon for Central Valley to get snow it may not be a lot but it might be some but the problem was somebody in Redding had to make the judgment calls whether or not to close the school and if it wasn't snowing there they're like ""What's the problem?""",22.277
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_91.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_91.txt,[laughter] The problem is that we have six inches of snow. [laughter],5.003
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_92.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_92.txt,So [tongue click] yeah So it's that much higher like,5.982
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_93.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_93.txt,Mm-hm. It's a higher elevation Um yeah um Central Valley and Shasta Lake is um about fifteen hundred feet um and in the winter time basically any time they start predicting two thousand twenty-five hundred there's a possibility it's slight but there's a possibility,22.591
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_94.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_94.txt,that we'll get snow Wow Um whereas Redding is I think their about six hundred feet or something six seven hundred feet so you know it really has to drop for Redding to get snow you know or there might be flurries but they won't stick yeah whereas up here [laughter],21.113
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_95.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_95.txt,Yes and no um I swear when I was younger we used to actually have four seasons where now I feel like we only have two [laughter],8.767
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_96.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_96.txt,Yeah it just seems like it's gotten a lot hotter as the years have gone by um I don't remember I mean maybe they did but I don't remember as a kid it being a hundred plus,16.646
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_97.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_97.txt,in the summer time but and I think our seasons have switched too they've shifted and a lot of people have said that that they feel like that because where as like schools have changed too it used to be you wouldn't start school till after labor day now they start like the middle of August,21.225
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_98.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_98.txt,and so the kids are going back when it's very very hot unfortunately um I mean I can remember doing school shopping in you'd be buying sweaters and long-sleeved things and all of this and it's like now you do that and you can't even wear them for for at least a couple of months cuz it's still a hundred degrees [tongue click] So and it would just be,21.694
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_99.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_99.txt,maybe starting to get a little hot when you were getting ready to go to summer vacation now it's like ah by the time summer vacation rolls around you're like get me in a pool [laughter] let me stay there for six months So but,21.336
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_100.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_100.txt,[tongue click] yeah I I don't know I in a lot of ways I feel like I've been reflecting a lot on my life especially since my dad passed away and uh like me going back to school happened after he passed away,15.54
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_101.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_101.txt,It's um my associates in science but it's business administration And uh Yeah I mean when I was younger I really seriously thought about being a teacher obviously both my parents were and uh when I was younger thinking about different colleges I would go to I remember when my brother was looking for colleges,22.143
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_102.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_102.txt,he pretty was set on Chico I think cuz it was close and a lot of his friends were going there but you know he also checked out some of the other ones. We went down to Sac State and I remember when I started thinking about colleges I thought about [tongue click] Chico a little bit I personally wasn't impressed with Chico,21.001
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_103.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_103.txt,and it wasn't necessarily so much educaitonal life it was I don't know campus life vibe whatever um I thought about um San Jose State because it's where both of my parents went,17.175
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_104.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_104.txt,And uh and then I also thought about Sac State Sac State's campus really impressed me,6.404
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_105.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_105.txt,Um I don't I don't know um I just got like a good feeling about it,5.998
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_106.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_106.txt,Um and my parents actually said um their choice would be that I did not go to San Jose State even though they went there,11.873
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_107.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_107.txt,Because um times had changed area had changed neighborhood had changed kind of rough yeah uh they said the school itself's very good but the area's not necessarily real great uh and then as I got older and then especially with the district changes and things like that I started,23.53
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_108.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_108.txt,tuning in a little bit more to my parents and things going on and uh especially in the classes and I'm like I don't think I want to be a teacher I don't think I have the tolerance for it and I know I wouldn't,14.351
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_109.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_109.txt,[tongue click] Um started getting involved in business stuff in offices and management things like that um you know I did the typical start out in fast food and,9.963
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_110.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_110.txt,You know retail and all of that and and then I just always knew I wanted to have some type of management position I mean I would love to have my business. What it would be I have no clue. but I have friends that s- say you've got a really good head on shoulders and you've got a very good way of thinking you would,20.288
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_111.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_111.txt,be great having your own business but you also have to have the financial backing [laughter] [laughter] which I really don't have at this at least at this point unless I win the lottery or something which would be great that would be great I mean my ideal thing would be if you know I was millionaire that I could be working here and I could volunteer work some other places,22.165
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_112.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_112.txt,but still have a very nice comfortable lifestyle and travel when I want to and you know things like that,6.739
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_113.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_113.txt,I mean both my mom and I have said that if we won the lottery that you know if it was a decent amount that you know we'd kinda set family members up and things like that,13.158
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_114.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_114.txt,exactly exactly you know do the scratcher things sometimes,5.843
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_115.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_115.txt,Yeah. Yeah. I and then uh my brother has his Bachelor's from Chico um Bachelor's of Science in Computer Technology or something I don't remember exactly what the [laughter] [laughter] terminology is but he does a lot of like IT programming and things and um,20.261
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_116.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_116.txt,so I I don't like the backend of it as wh- as I call it Uh-huh. to computer stuff all the programming and stuff it drives me insane.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_186.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_186.txt,so that you know it doesn't necessarily have to be this specific school but it does have to be in Redding. an agreement between the two parties so I'm like so when I lived down there for a couple of years we uh for our drop off met in Cottonwood cuz it was like a midpoint,20.77
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_187.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_187.txt,so but yeah I I thought it was crazy but you know I even had to get a court order just to move,6.707
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_188.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_188.txt,I do. I do. Um [tongue click] [sigh] i- if I had the opportunity to be more like maybe down on the Nappa Valley um one of things I love about it down there is you're you're so close to everything. I mean really in the summer we took a trip down to Santa Rosa and Sacremento and Vallejo and all of that but,25.101
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_189.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_189.txt,even if you're in like the Nappa Valley area you have main cities. I mean Sacramento's like an hour away so you know you could fly out. There's big events there. That I think is probably the only thing I'm sorry of as far as living in Redding that there's not necessarily more to do for the kids,21.25
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_190.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_190.txt,and in more family-type activities. I mean there are things obviously um but it's nice to have the options at least of you know like down in San Diego I mean I know my brother and his family go a lot they have season passes to the zoo to the wild animal park,20.616
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_191.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_191.txt,"to um you know they go to Seaport Village a lot you know there's just there's more opportunity of kind of things to do. Or you know somebody comes into town and it's like ""Oh hey let's go do this"" Yeah exactly. Yeah exactly. Um restaurant wise",20.232
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_192.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_192.txt,I don't know I wish Redding would figure something out because it seems like it's one extreme or the other. It's like overkill and fast food or there are some nice restaurants but there's also some restaurants that I feel are out of place uh little too high end. And I'm wondering how in the world they're surviving because even with doctors and lawyers in town you know [laughter],22.907
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_193.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_193.txt,I mean there's a couple pretty nice restaurants around the area even and they're about fifty bucks a plate and it's like this isn't New York [laughter] You know So I don't know it it's been intersting to see how things have changed,22.981
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_194.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_194.txt,"I think somewhat. Um I mean even my brother feels like this is Hick Central up here and I tease him and I say ""Well you're from here."" ""but I left"" Well ""you're still from here"" [laughter] Um yeah I think somewhat um",21.622
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_195.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_195.txt,you know I've I've heard I don't know personally but I've heard you know this kind of center region has especially the last I don't know maybe ten years has uh developed a lot more with gang-like activity um which when I was growing up that I was aware of,21.426
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_196.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_196.txt,it was like L.A. maybe East Oakland or something um so I hate to see that that's kind of spreading out more um you know supposedly from what I've heard you do not go to Santa Cruz Boardwalk at night cuz apparently gang activity's very very high,21.304
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_197.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_197.txt,um even when we were in Vallejo this summer um w- we left in the evening about two to three hours later than we had planned. You just you know get busy and don't get out of the park And I had heard stories about Vallejo even and there that things could start getting bad and I'm just,20.227
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_198.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_198.txt,It's like I want out of here I don't want to be and especially with two small kids I'm like you know I don't want a gang fight or something to start out,7.442

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_205.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_205.txt,she kept building on the house for some reason she wouldn't die so she had people con- contractors and stuff in there twenty-four seven building so you take this tour of the house and it's if I remember right it's at least a couple hours It's it's crazy,21.575
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_206.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_206.txt,the stuff in this place I mean it's it's cool but it's just crazy I mean there are um stairways that lead to a ceiling there's [laughter] I mean you walk up you're gonna hit your head There's you know you open a door and there's no stairs,20.942

I want to say Santiago but it's something close to that if it's not that and um and I know he's got stuff all over the world and I I think he's a great designer but I think it's out of place in Redding and I personally,22.16
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_243.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_243.txt,am tired of seeing that bridge every time I turn around on you know artwork and calendars and it's like oh come on guys [laughter] So you know there's some people that feel that way and there's some that are just like oh it's this great thing so it's just kinda like you know I'll respect your opinion.

I'm not sure if you've been over there but it's,24.838
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_245.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_245.txt,oh okay um it's very uh to me commercialized um you know you you've you've got the hotels the restaurants. It's all chain stuff that you can see anywhere exactly and a lot of empty strip malls. Yeah.,20.304
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_246.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_246.txt,And that that is a topic that is a pet peeve with a lot of people in the area is that you know they talk about building new things and it's like how about using some of the things we've already got. So,14.91
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_247.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_247.txt,It has uh gone down quite a bit. My aunt's actually a realator uh aunt that lives here in town and uh yeah I know she's been struggling for probably a couple years so um [tongue click] yeah it's,20.4

Very small by today's standards but it works.,23.806
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_253.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_253.txt,There are there are um in fact when I was growing up um just kind of down the road from us there is an area called Toyon and actually the grammar school I went to was called Toyon and uh,14.719
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_254.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_254.txt,Yeah. and it's actually not even there anymore it closed when I was in school oh I don't remember when. Um they had like a a Toyon it's it's the Wintou tribe that's the Wintou tribe And uh,19.481
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_255.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_255.txt,They no they didn't run the school but they just I think named it because it was in the general vacinity um but um like between my house and where I went to school there was an area that was considered like a Toyon area and there was like a Wintou center or something and um that little area,20.467
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_256.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_256.txt,was where a lot of them live and and I don't know or remember all the details but um for some time um there were a lot of them living there. And they have like no power no water no whatever and I,20.788
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_257.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_257.txt,I don't know if it was like a government battle kind of thing going on between them and the the tribe or what and it got to a point where they were gonna close it down They got evicted out had to move out of their areas um,16.793
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_258.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_258.txt,Some of them yeah. And uh so that hit very close to home for me and I just remember telling people like parents and stuff I'm like this isn't right I mean these people are getting kicked out of their house and they're like yeah but in some ways it's a good thing because they're they've been living there for months without electricity without water without,23.014

Is the community center still there? No. It was torn down So if you drive if you guys get a chance you ought to go out to Shasta Dam,22.291
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_260.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_260.txt,It is it actually yeah.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_261.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_261.txt,and you just take that and you go all the way through town um and then yeah you'll get to a like an intersection and you can either go straight or you can go right and that brings you around the lake um but you know if you go straight you can come up and you'll see the dam and Mount Shasta and everything,16.657
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_262.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_262.txt,I I'm actually not a a lake person.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_263.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_263.txt,because it just seemed like whenever we went into the lake there was always like nasty stuff in the water you'd step on Whiskey Town between the two I think Whiskey Town's a much prettier lake. Had a friend that had a boat years ago that I used to go out with sometimes. He had a Cadmaran and great to go cruising around on that um but you know the thing about Whiskey Town is that it can be a hundred and twenty outside but that lake I swear is like fifty-five degrees [laughter],24.068
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_24_part_264.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_24_part_264.txt,Yeah. Yeah. It's just it always amazes me how cold it is. It's crazy I put my feet in the Sacramento,8.896

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_2.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_2.txt,but um I was only ten years old when the war ended so growing up in Sacramento at that time um was very peaceful. Uh the only unusual thing about it is I can remember between ages six and ten there were no young men around and that the few young men you did see on the streets uh were all in uniform,22.091
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_3.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_3.txt,so um and I took that for granted and I also took it for granted that all of the newspaper articles and all of the movies that we saw were all war things. They were all either propaganda or stories about war um you know the whole world was caught up in it. I just took it for granted cuz it's all I knew but other than that it was a very normal,22.404
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_4.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_4.txt,but you know I was about a block away from the park and um lots of kids my age all up and down the street as well as my brothers were quite a bit older than I so most of my playmates were from school and from the neighborhood and uh in those days our time was not programmed the way I see my children and grandchildren programmed. We had lots of free time,22.715
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_5.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_5.txt,and the way we would play would be go up and down the street and yell hey Charlie hey Bill hey Margie come on out and play. We'd form our own games. We'd play hide and seek kick the can til it got dark. We had a -- two baseball fields right down the street from us in the park. We had lots of -- lots of baseball games all summer that would last for hours and hours,20.922
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_6.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_6.txt,um it -- it was a -- it was a wonderful place to grow up. Um our schools were all you know walking distance and all connected to one another. The school yards were actually connected. I went to Crocker elementary school California Junior High School and McClatchy Senior high School and all the yards were connected and they were all walking distance from my home and so uh,25.646
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_7.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_7.txt,very -- I was very cloistered. Um hardly uh went out of the neighborhood. Didn't have to. Um walked to and from school with my friends. Um didn't get a -- I got a car when I was about sixteen and then course I would drive to school but uh it -- it was {CG} got a nice education. Uh At that time in Sacramento -- Sacramento was only --,23.804
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_8.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_8.txt,population was only about a hundred thousand in the city limits those days um we felt that places like Fair Oaks where we're sitting now and uh Carmichael and these places they were all out in the country. They had nothing to do with us and our high school -- we only had two high schools in Sacramento -- two public high schools. McClatchy High School and Sacramento High School that was it then there was Christian Brothers and Saint Mary's the --,22.279
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_9.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_9.txt,the Catholic schools for the boys and girls that was it and uh great rivalry between those high schools as I recall. Lots of wonderful big games and so forth.,11.31
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_10.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_10.txt,I ran the hundred in ten two when I was like a junior in high school which was one of the best times in the state. There was only one guy who could beat me and uh he became a great athlete at Cal. He was the top uh uh hundred yard dash man at Cal uh and won the Cal big ten championships and,22.038
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_11.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_11.txt,was their starting fullback and so he was my competition but he was my only competition. I played lots of baseball and basketball but that was junior varsity stuff because I was very small in stature. I -- I -- I had very good hand eye coordination. I was fast but I was too small to play varsity sports uh in school so mostly it was uh junior varsity and lots of pick up -- lots of pick up games and,24.576
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_12.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_12.txt,we had you know outside leagues uh night leagues and um things uh for things that are -- that were similar to what um little league is now but they were just called different things like hundred pound hundred and fifty pound so forth. Certain age groups would play in these you know in these leagues. Uh Never lost for things to do. Um,21.437
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_13.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_13.txt,Can't remember any horrible experiences growing up before leave for -- for Berkeley for college. Um I got to be president of my class a couple times. I got to -- my junior high school -- I got to be president of my high school. Um had lots of fri- +friends had wonderful social life.,20.454
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_14.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_14.txt,Um very loving supportive parents except when I finally told them what I wanted to do was go into show business and they became totally non supportive and they said no you're gonna do like your brothers and go to Cal and you're gonna get an education and get a profession and then if you're still interested so I got no financial or moral support to go into uh show business,21.541
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_15.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_15.txt,so what happened is that I became a trial lawyer which frankly is show business. It's -- it's directing producing -- it's putting on a show for twelve people over and over again. {LG}  Anyway after I retired from being a judge and a prosecutor and a trial lawyer my wife,20.326
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_16.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_16.txt,after getting sick of hearing me say after watching movies or television I could do that stop saying it and go do it uh she -- she kicked me out the door basically and I went out and auditioned for a small part here in town. This was many years got it and I've never stopped since. I mean I don't -- I don't think there's been more than a month at a time,20.126
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_17.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_17.txt,in the last ten to fifteen years that I hadn't been either rehearsing or performing something. Both here and in southern California because you asked about residency I should say this. Although I grew up here starting twenty years ago my wife and I have spent virtually half the time in Rancho Mirage in southern California near Palm Springs,20.351
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_18.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_18.txt,so I became a --  I became a golfer and we uh have been living on golf courses up here and six months up here and six months down there so we've had homes in both -- both venues  and what else about my childhood? Well --,19.954
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_19.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_19.txt,from Cal and um had a good chance at a job I thought in the bay area. I wanted to be a -- either a prosecutor or a public defender cuz I knew I wanted trial practice. That was -- if I couldn't get into trial practice I would not have practiced law cuz I needed something that was like show business so if I didn't get that I would've tried to become a theatrical agent,21.147
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_20.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_20.txt,you know something of that sort with my law background but I never was interested in any other field of law except -- except trial the show you know {LG} I don't know if you know this most people don't. Only five percent of the practicing lawyers try cases regularly. It's sort of like being a surgeon -- a specialist. Other lawyers refer you their cases when they get up to the point when they know they're gonna have to go to trial so there are trial specialists. I was one of those. It's all I did.,26.248
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_21.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_21.txt,were talking about my job out of law school. I found out there was a three year residency requirement before you could get jobs in either Marin County or Oak- +Oakland or Alameda County where I thought I had good chances for jobs. They said gee you do. You've got the qualifications but you'd have to live here three years and practice somewhere else first and then then we'd get you a job and I said I can't wait three years,22.199
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_22.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_22.txt,um I already had my first child. I needed -- I couldn't do that so I was offered a Ford Foundation Grant to work with the state legislature up here since they knew I was born and raised here and I did that until I was a -- I -- I -- until I was able to talk my way into the Sacramento District Attorney's office. I got a job in the D A's office,22.17
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_23.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_23.txt,so my first job was as a prosecutor. I got to try gosh at least fifty or sixty cases there before I decided to -- to leave and go on to private practice so I've had uh and you won't find lawyers nowadays who do this. I've had over a hundred jury trials and you just don't get the opportunity anymore to do that. I've never run into a lawyer in Sacramento,21.375
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_24.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_24.txt,um who has that kind of -- that number of jury trials. Just not done anymore. Cases that the courts are too crowded um -- things are so different. When I went into the D A's office there were only twelve superior courts -- I knew every judge by -- you know everybody knew everybody by first name. There were twelve superior courts all in the same building.,20.308
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_25.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_25.txt,Now there are probably uh -- uh ten times that probably a hundred and twenty. And so I mean the -- the -- everything has gone up by ten times including the population uh the number of courts the number of attorneys the number of judges -- it's ten times -- the number of high schools for example. I've not even heard of some of the high schools around here.,17.262
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_26.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_26.txt,Well of course  it doesn't have to said that growth can be -- can be helpful and harmful in both ways. I think that we have become a less personalized city. Um I used to be able to go downtown as a young person and I'd always run into people I knew. You'd walk down K street and,25.538
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_27.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_27.txt,you'd be shaking hands and stopping and visiting every other block. My father was in business and my uncle was in business downtown and um I knew a -- you know I knew many many of the business owners along K street and J street and it was kind of nice to be able to um -- that's another thing that -- that I think growth and -- and the growth of the city and the change in times,24.414
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_28.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_28.txt,made it tougher for kids. Um I was able to go downtown alone and go to movies alone when I was seven or eight years old. Nobody ever even thought about -- that a child was going to be harmed. We didn't have sexual predators. We didn't have any- +anyone -- we kept our doors and windows open at night. There were no burglaries ever in our neighborhoods. Um so yes growth is great economically,23.431
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_29.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_29.txt,and it's bound to happen because of the birth rate and so forth but frankly I think it's a lot easier and a lot more peaceful and a lot less stressful to live in the Sacramento I grew up in than in the Sacramento my grandchildren are growing up in. They're totally scheduled. They have to be with adults when they go anywhere.,20.59
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_30.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_30.txt,Uh they're m- +my my -- my children wouldn't think of allowing their children t- +to to to go downtown alone at age ten or eleven or twelve. Um so -- so e- +everything everything has changed and I don't necessarily think that's for the better. Obviously economically um -- looking for jobs and -- and uh wanting to be a major metropolitan area growth is good. But I -- I don't think it's --,24.507
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_31.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_31.txt,for general family life frankly I think it sucks. I'm glad that I grew up in the time that I did. I'm glad that I had a full time mother at home. I'm glad that I was able to uh -- to be out on my own in -- in the Sacramento area not be fearful of everything. I was glad I had free time and wasn't scheduled for every little,20.751
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_32.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_32.txt,thing that I did like my grandkids are. Um so in a lot of ways I feel a bit sorry for the kids nowadays because they have no concept of -- of how peaceful and nice {LG} it was to grow up in my era. They just don't -- they wouldn't understand it. [] Of course we didn't have any social -- they have the advantages of social media if it is an advantage.,20.487
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_33.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_33.txt,Television -- I didn't even have television. We had radio. That was it. So you had to imagine what was going on which is not all bad you know. Um sometimes I think that uh -- technology gets in the way of socializing. I find that sometimes when I'm trying to communicate with people,21.082
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_34.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_34.txt,they're not listening they're looking at their cell phones or they're playing games on their cell phones um. I -- it's just a less personal world than it used to be. People aren't paying attention to one another as much. We didn't have road rage when I was a kid because there was no problem on the road it wasn't crowded um my commutes downtown to go to work were -- were wonderful. I'd get downtown in ten minutes --,24.448
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_35.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_35.txt,covered parking -- no -- no -- no bumper to b- +bumper-- not only not bumper to bumper you could go whatever speed you wanted driving on the -- on the freeways here. So uh -- yeah I think -- I think I was lucky being able to live and work back when I did -- when I see what people have to put up with now commuting for example I just can't imagine it. I'd hate it.,22.873
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_36.txt,I loved what I did be- +before -- I think I'd hate it now. I think I'd find a way to get out maybe go to a less densely populated area especially if I was raising a family.,10.888
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_37.txt,and out of the hustle and bustle and bumper to bumper traffic that commuting -- you know that jobs require you to commute nowadays. I don't think I'd like it so I didn't have to make those choices. I was lucky. I got to live in my own home town and things didn't get what I -- what I would c- +call -- say out of hand until I was y- +[] nearly ready to retire you know. I didn't have to fight much of what people fight now.,23.338
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_38.txt,My grandparents arrived here in the eighteen-seventies. My grandparents helped to found the first reform Jewish temple west of Chicago. It's even older than the Jewish reform temples in the major metropolitan areas here in the West. It's older than anything in Los Angeles or anything in San Fransisco. And my grandparents were part of for- +forming forming that.,22.885
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_39.txt,Um so we go back to about eighteen-seventy. My grandmother was born in [] Nevada but came here when she was still fairly young,8.745
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_40.txt,My mother was born here in eighteen ninety-eight and went to Sacramento high school when it was downtown. She taught at uh San- +San Jose she uh she went to school at San Jose State when it was just a teacher's college and she taught in a one room schoolhouse in Gault -- taught grammar school. Um so,20.967
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_41.txt,my parents lived in a Sacramento that was even smaller and more personal than what I grew up in. Yes and my uncle had a store downtown called the I X L men's store it was [] and ninth on J street and everybody knew about it. Everybody knew the I X L and I of course was um raised working in the basement and,23.155
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_42.txt,learned to sell. I was on the floor selling clothes by the time I was about fourteen. My father had a small men's clothing store between fourth and fifth on K street and so both my dad and my uncle and by the way I grew up right next door to this uncle in Lamb's park. We lived next door to each other. My father and his brother were next door neighbors which was nice too. I had a --,20.5
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_43.txt,a second mother and father right next door. So they were both in the clothing business. My uncle's uh children took over the business and turned it into an enormous conglomerate where they had at one time thirty-nine or forty stores -- men's clothing stores uh called Kaufman's -- our name -- Kaufman's men's store,22.424
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_44.txt,which were soled to an eastern conglomerate about in the nineteen-seventies and uh but before that everybody knew th- +[] -- knew my name and assumed I was part of that business which I wasn't. It was my uncle's and my cousine's so Kaufman's was a name that was known in the Sacramento area because of all these stores.,20.088
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_45.txt,My father also had a drug store in the thirties called Kaufman's drugs down on sixth and J so the name's been around uh Sacramento for quite a long time. My grandfather's name was Gus Marks and he had a s- +store clothing store called Mark's clothing store for men as far back as the nineteen-twenties,20.724
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_46.txt,and when he became ill in the forties my dad took that store over. So uh um so that part of my -- on my father's side mostly business peope and uh lots of academic people came- +came -- uh sp- +sprung -- have sprung from my family here in Sacramento.,22.264
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_47.txt,Uh the books you see on the table here are all written and edited by our children uh one of our children um is the linguist I told you about who's a P H D.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_54.txt,visit a lot at each other's homes like my cousin Stewart who's the fammous scientist now um he was just a little kid to me he was like five years younger than I so we would play together and I taught him how to do lots of things ride his bicycle tie his shoes just things that big brothers do for little brothers but um I was very close to my -- my aunts and my uncles and they all -- we had a Kaufman family on every avenue in Lamb Park,27.194
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_55.txt,so it was -- that was another good thing about growing up here I -- I was surrounded by uh caring family um starting at -- at seventh avenue -- seventh avenue eigth avenue ten-eighth way which is the combination of ten and ninth avenue eleventh avenue. We lived on twelfth avenue and my uncles and aunts lived right next door to us,20.614
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_56.txt,so we had about five Kaufman families living all within walking distance of one another so I was very close to them and we -- I mean we -- we didn't have to announce ourselves we'd just drop in on each other regularly and uh just visit and my mother and father same way they were all intertwined a lot um did a lot of things together I mean they'd play cards together they'd go to movies together they'd have dinner at each other's homes.,25.583
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_57.txt,On the Jewish holdiays we'd always be together. We had a very small Jewish community of reform -- the reform Jewish community was when I was growing up probably about a hundred people and everybody knew everybody -- everybody and you know all -- we had -- I had Sunday school friends so I had a -- I had a Jewish social life Jewish friends and then I had my school social life which had nothing to do with being Jewish,23.566
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_58.txt,but uh there was no anti-semitism that I could sense growing up. Nobody gave a damn what religion you were. None of the kids around me cared. Their parents didn't seem to care so there was lots of interchange and um I think that's gotten a little different nowadays there's a little bit more  racial awareness lets say. We had no racial problems because there were no races.,23.465
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_59.txt,There were caucasians. In my school of two-thousand in McClatchey I think we had I don't know maybe six or seven African Americans  who we called Negroes which you don't do anymore but six or seven is all. Maybe another half a dozen or a dozen Asians maybe twenty twenty-five thirty hispanics,21.635
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_60.txt,and the rest were all just what I call white bread and whether you were Jewish whether you were Jewish Protestant Catholic didn't matter all caucasians. And I think that's part of what made things easier in those days. We didn't have any gangs we didn't have,21.598
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_61.txt,racial tensions.  We didn't have races {LG} that's why -- we -- we were kind of uh unilateral uh racially. ,15.608
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_62.txt,I got the lead in my senior play in high school and that's where I got a taste for it and then I I was always a singer uh from the time I was a little kid I was entertaining people singing and playing piano by ear and I was obviously a musician and when I so I sang in lots of choruses and so forth before I ever got to Berkeley. When I got to Berkeley I got into the University of California Glee Club and met lots of musical people that way and I had a roommate that was,27.394
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_63.txt,could've been a professional musician. He was fantastic could sing could play four or five instruments. We're still close. We still uh close after all this time. Sixty years he's been my friend and we formed a quartet that became so successful that we um got into -- we -- we were unionized and,20.068
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_64.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_64.txt,we sang in nightclubs all over the -- all over San Francisco so when I was as ear- +early early as seventeen or eighteen years old I was not only in the senior octet at Cal I was the first freshman ever -- it was usually reserved for seniors but I was good enough that when I first went in they made me part of the senior octet and then we had this professional quartet,22.47
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_65.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_65.txt,that opened shows for lots of major stars. Lots of major stars. Stan Kenton who you're too young to remember was probably the best noted big band leader in the country at the time and he offered us a contract if we could go out on the road with him that he would bring us back to L A and see to it that we got a --,20.193
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_66.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_66.txt,a -- a capital records contract and uh sold on our sound and the guys -- the other three guys were -- they had their own professions. They were scientists -- one of 'em was a physicist one was a chemist um the other was a -- wanted -- gonna be an attorney and they had families. They were older than I. They were -- they wouldn't go,20.182
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_67.txt,so I had to give up that incredible show business opportunity so I -- I always had the taste for show business. I wanted to do it. When that chance got blown I was devastated. I went into the Navy as a matter of fact in the middle of Cal I went in the Navy for two years came back and then finished up but  I didn't start,21.134
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_68.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_68.txt,theater until I think I was sixty-seven years old,5.648
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_69.txt,because even starting at that late age I've received I'm the only actor in Sacramento ever to get back to back Ellie Awards for best actor of the year and how do you do that when no training -- no -- no experience and do it when you're seventy years old? I don't know but it's always been in there. It's always been a natural thing for me. I always knew I could act.,21.332
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_70.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_70.txt,When I would watch movies I knew I could've done that so yes. I can't say I'm bitter about because I had a wonderful profession and a good family life and show business is a nasty nasty life. It is even if you're successful and the chances of making it are you know it's like trying to be a professional athlete. There're fifty good people for every part that's available.,23.103
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_71.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_71.txt,I mean it's -- it's a -- it's a rat race so I know my parents were right in that record. They realized that my chances of really making it -- making a living at that were pretty slim and they were right um but the reason I'm a little  sorry about not going into it sooner is not necessarily that I would've been a famous Hollywood star,22.969
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_72.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_72.txt,but because I would've been able to participate in community theaters at a high level for lots of years. I missed thirty or forty years of community theater. I would've loved that. I probably would've end up having my own community theater and directing and casting and producing and all because I have a flair and a love of that. I -- I don't need to be paid for it.,20.506
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_73.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_73.txt,It's like when we were singing for money in the bay area it's like you know it's like can you believe they're paying us for this? I would do this -- I'd pay them to do this in a minute That's the way I feel about what I do now. I -- I would pay to do what I'm doing now. It is so dear to me. I love the work so much and I -- I love working with other actors so much that um,21.539
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_74.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_74.txt,that's why I'm sorry I missed thirty or forty years more of that. I started so late that I have -- and also I missed some great parts because you're so limited in the roles you can take when you're sixty-five and over uh and I would've loved to have played some of those roles and I know I could have. I watch some young people now playing uh leads in their thirties and,21.502
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_75.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_75.txt,twenties thirties and forties -- I know I could've done that and I would've loved it so yes tha- +that for that I am sorry but you know uh --,6.819
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_76.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_76.txt,Oh I more than made up for lost time because when I look at my resume it pretty much compares with the resumes of my friends who've been doing it for thirty years. You know that -- nobody does more than one or two plays a year. They can't they've got a life you know? Um it takes two and a half or three months to to be in a play with a significant part. You have to rehearse for a couple of months and then you have to perform for a couple of months and people with outside jobs and families,27.911
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_77.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_77.txt,I've already got that many you know and I've done film and I've done -- nothing you would've heard of but locally I'm known. Um Well I have some -- some nice things have been written and I remember a review in the Folsom Telegraph where the reviewer said that he had seen me and I mean this was -- this was -- he was watching a show with ten people in it,24.179
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_78.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_78.txt,and he said that he and his daughter selected me as the best actor that they'd seen in years and I just thought this is -- this is out of sight. I can't believe this and he -- how lucky the community is to have Kauffman you know on stage and this is when I'm seventy-two years old and had -- ony had five years of it,16.941
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_79.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_79.txt,and they're sort of miniature Academy Awards. It's it's the -- it's not just Sacramento. It involves two hundred and fifty plays at about eighty venues all over northern and central California so about eighty theaters are involved. Two hundred and fifty plays are judged. Five people are nominated for best actor five for best actress,23.337
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_80.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_80.txt,It's a real honor just to get nominated. Well in -- in four years I was nominated three times and won twice in a row. I haven't talked to anybody or seen anybody in the history of -- who's ever done that which really amazes me. Um m- +my my wife so that she didn't have to be alone when I'm out at night so muh decided to get into show business into theater.,22.89
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_81.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_81.txt,She started as a props person gradauted up to becoming a stage manager. Now she directs plays. She directs me and she directs lots of other people so,10.488
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_82.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_82.txt,We retired on the same day as a matter of fact um so yes it's become a family thing and my grandkids uh saw what we were doing got interested and both of my local grandchildren who live in Gold River about ten minutes from here are deeply involved in theater. They've done maybe -- they're only ten and fourteen and they have done probably at least fifteen shows a piece,23.956
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_83.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_83.txt,so then -- and they're triple treats like (()) they act they sing they dance uh so they te- +(()) they -- they saw what grandpa was doing and thought this -- this could be fun. For the very first time the last play we did my grandson was on stage with me and had lines opposite me so that was a -- gave me goose- +goosebumps gives me goosebumps to think about it. Um he's ten years old,21.066
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_84.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_84.txt,so uh I've got uh seventy years on him and who would've ever -- my wife keeps saying who would've thunk you know? That I would I would ever be on stage much less with a grandson -- with -- with a big audiance watching so very thrilling. Uh I guess my most thrilling thing in -- in -- as far as acting was that several years ago with only three years experience I saw an advertisement for,25.796
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_85.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_85.txt,a play that was being cast in Burbank  and was going to be performed in southern California Palm Springs area and I recognized the names uh of actors -- movie actors I knew who were in it already cast and I said to my wife I'm gonna get in a plane and go down and -- and -- and audition. She said are you crazy? Come on. I said oh what can I lose? It's a turn around trip. I'll pay for it. I'll get -- it'll,23.584
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_86.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_86.txt,just be an experience. I don't expect to get the part. Well I got the part. I got a co lead opposite a guy who'd done fifty movies. He even had a lead opposite Katherine Hepburn These people were all on the Tonight Show Johnny Carson reguarly. I mean people who's -- and everybody recognized them. You wouldn't know 'em cuz you're too young but everybody my age knew these actors,21.839
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_87.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_87.txt,and when they-- they couldn't believe that I would would've even gone and tried for it much less got it so I spent four months um performing with these professional actors. I was really the only ama- +amateur and it made me a pro. Most people have to work like hell to get a equity card. This got me equity so I can go audition for just equity for professional,21.305
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_88.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_88.txt,shows if I want to. The truth is I don't want to because it uh  it wouldn't allow me to do all this community theater. Doing community theater I can have my wife direct I can pick the plays I want talk the local community theater people who know us into doing a play at the right time when we're here and not in Southern California,21.747
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_89.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_89.txt,um do the play we want I can cast it myself which I -- I like that almost as much as acting auditioning and casting the play I love that um so I -- I want to stay away from the professional I don't want to be with people who are doing it for the money. I want to meet with people who are doing it because they love to do it and you'd be surprised how many so called amateur actors are who are better than some of the pros.,23.199
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_90.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_90.txt,It's amazing cuz I've crossed over and I've been with both groups and yes they have more experience on the pro side but does thata make all of them better? Not necessarily. Not necessarily. I know a lot of uh non equity performers who I'd much rather cast in my plays than the some of those pros so it's -- it's an interesting uh,20.96
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_91.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_91.txt,so we have an interesting life. We have golf we have grandhildren we have theater together um my wife loves to travel I hate it now but {LG},9.952
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_92.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_92.txt,it's a double edged feeling very proud of her for doing it um yeah sometimes I disagree with her but she never tells me what to do on stage because she's never acted um she's never been on stage and she doesn't care to be. She -- she's totally opposite personality as I. She's a listener she's not a talker,22.107
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_93.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_93.txt,she's quiet and she's uh reserved and I'm type A she's type B it's all opposites attract stuff so um we don't fight about anything it's fairly easy because she takes my word for it when I want to do something she just says fine you know so we don't -- we don't fight about it,21.89
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_94.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_94.txt,and I ike the way she handles other people -- handles it much better than I could because she's' sweet she's kind they all love her. I wouldn't be that way. {LG} I'd be a crack the whipper so when I can no longer remember a hundred pages of dialogue which will be soon I'll probably start directing and I'll be a totally different kind of director than she is,20.095
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_95.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_95.txt,uh I'll call upon my acting skills and background to try to tell other actors how to do it better. She'll never do that. She'll make little suggestions but let them do their own thing.,11.388

It was just a terrible grind because even at that time only about one out of twenty at Boalt got in so the -- the uh -- the competition was absolutely fierce. I'd never experienced -- school was always pretty easy for me. I kinda glided. Uh I wasn't a great student but I didn't have the competition,21.474
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_117.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_117.txt,that I faced in -- in law school and I realized that one out of every three of us was gonna get dumped after the first year. That -- that was the system. We started off three hundred and you end up with two hundred and that was it. No matter how good you were if you were in the bottom third you were through so there was this tremendous pressure you know the guys around me lo- +lots lots of people from ivy league schools who had been at the top of their class excetera,24.947
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_118.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_118.txt,um and I was a B plus student at Cal. I wasn't -- uh I wasn't equipped to compete with some of the people that were there but you know I ended up something like sixtieth in the class. Not only made it through the two-thirds but I ended up about sixtieth in a class of two hundred and uh didn't enjoy the first year because of the worry -- the competition I'm afraid if I don't make it what do I do next?,23.833
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_119.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_119.txt,Uh after I made it (()) second and third year I could just concentrate on -- uh I got to select some of the subjects I wanted like trial practice and um torts and uh things I wanted to do and was interested in and didn't have the pressure. Once as hard as it is getting one-third cut the good thing about that at a Stanford or a Cal,20.276
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_120.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_120.txt,is once you make it you know you're gonna get your degree. They don't cut you after the -- after the big cut of the first year. You know you're gonna go through so a lot of the pressure's off til the bar exam which is more pressure. You know if you go to on eof the good schools your chances of passing the bar are excellent. Eighty-five percent. I think ninety percent of my class passed the first time so,22.082
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_121.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_121.txt,I -- it's hard work and there's pressure don't get me wrong but you're pretty enough to know you're prepared for it.,6.452
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_122.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_122.txt,Yeah uh it's really st- +strange strange family planning. We didn't that we couldn't afford to have children until I knew I was gonna be practicing law til I at least passed the bar and uh just coicidentally our -- uh the first birth was the day after I finished the bar exam.,21.225
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_123.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_123.txt,It wasn't on purpose it just happened that way. {LG} We wanted to wait a bit longer than that.,5.031
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_124.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_124.txt,But fortunately I -- I did pass and a- +and and I was able to work right -- right after I passed the bar I got this Ford Foundation grant to work with the legislature and then immediately after that I was hired as deputy district attorney and I -- I worked for thirty-five years in in the law field after that and did -- did pretty well if I do say so.,21.648
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_125.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_125.txt,Did enough to retire uh -- uh fairly early and -- and live a wonderfully comfortable life {LG} as you can see. {LG} Yeah,8.607
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_126.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_126.txt,I enjoyed uh -- I enjoyed working here more than I would now. Uh things were on a shake hands basis. You didn't get papered to death by your adversaries. Um I didn't feel like I was wasting time. There wasn't a lot of anger at one another. Uh it was uh -- it was more like a fraternity where even the people on the other side realized you know you're just doing what you have to do and,22.814
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_127.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_127.txt,we're all friends and we'd -- people I tried cases against we'd go out and have a drink together afterwards. That was very common. We all knew each other. Everybody knew each other's abilities weaknesses and strengths and we all knew the judges. They knew us by first name. We did things on shake hands basis. You could trust the guy across the aisle. Um it's not that way at all anymore. It's -- it's just cut throat awful.,23.385
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_128.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_128.txt,Um I talk to lawyers now what they go through. I -- I wouldn't do it now. Again just timing I was very fortunate to be in that field in the time I was because yeah it was a pleasure. I mean I don' tmean every day was a joy. Hard work -- uh you know obviously some clients you didn't care to represent and um just like any business or profession there're,22.156
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_129.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_129.txt,good days and bad days but I had a lot more good ones than bad ones and -- and uh didn't go around aggravated. I -- I was pretty self satisfied most of the time but you know I -- I was happy with what I did. I think I won ninety-five percent of my trials so that makes you happy too. I worked like a dog. I mean I think I think I worked harder than anybody who ever tried a case against me. I was up all -- just like I work at acting. I mean I'm,25.674
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_130.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_130.txt,I'm always the first one off the script or to know the script because I'm just com- +compulsive I'm compulsive. I just have to work all the time at something I'm interested in so that's what got me into acting is because I loved playing golf after I retired but I always needed to do something creative and something with my mind that drives me,22.653
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_131.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_131.txt,cuz I'm up in the middle of the night every night and what do I do? I get out a script,5.887
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_132.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_132.txt,so it did -- it keeps you young. It's uh even better than crossword puzzles. How many men my age get to work with people your age regularly you know? It just doesn't happen. That's what I love about theater. I'm constantly working with people of all ages from -- from kids to college age to thirties and forties to people my own age just,21.601
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_133.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_133.txt,great cross section of not only ages but  race -- racial crossovers um academic differences uh financial differences um people from all walks of life walk into that theater and wanna be part of a -- a play. It's just amazing,22.373
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_134.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_134.txt,so it's uh -- it's -- it's a terrific invigorating experience that I think keeps me a lot younger than my years. I mean I'm in my eightieth year and I don't feel like it mentally at all. I feel like I can do every bit as much mentally as I could do when I was sixty Not be- +before not -- not -- not forty not fifty but sixty,22.128

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_136.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_136.txt,Yeah Most people my age I don't know a little bored with life maybe unable to -- they're certainly not out functioning the way we are most people. Although I do have a ninety-seven year old brother retired surgeon I was telling you about.

By that I mean that they're  obviously this is not going to sound politically correct but the people who live in trailer parks don't speak the way I speak or the way my close friends speak. I notice a -- a difference in levels of education,20.045
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_139.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_139.txt,with different vocabularies and different ways of expressing themselves. I don't know that I would call it difference in accent as much in difference in use of vocabulary.,11.672
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_140.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_140.txt,differences in pronounciation as much as differences in the use of the language um so I -- you know I don't see anything as being Sacramento.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_142.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_142.txt,have all the time uh Chico REdding uh I notice no difference in their speech unless they come from another state and they still have a hold over accent but for those who are uh been around here for a long time uh I -- I go back to -- to -- I got around more when I was practicing law and talked to people my own,20.251
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_143.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_143.txt,educational level a lot I noticed no differences in their -- and still don't in their uh speech patterns or -- or their accent. They sound the same as to me as I do to me or as my wife does,14.607
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_144.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_144.txt,We're constantly surrounded by people from Chicago from New York from uh south of the Mason Dixon um and of course there are tremendous differences there but it has nothing to do with California. As far as the people I know who were born and raised in southern California,20.536
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_145.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_145.txt,as I had cousins who were I found that -- we found no differences in our -- in our accents. Um I -- I was -- I -- I used to see my uncle in Los Angeles you know once a year whatever. It never occured to us that we talked any differently because we didn't.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_146.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_146.txt,we were the same family same type of education probably same type I Q's and close enough and we -- we had the same use of language and I don't think we ever would've dreamed of saying you have an accent because you're from L A no.,12.95

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_150.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_150.txt,Yeah here's why. Here's the -- here's the big bowl it starts here. Sacramento San Joaquin and you go over the Tehachapis you got another bowl. Southern California bowl. That's the way -- I've always seen it that way and every time my family would drive to visit L A peo- +people uh relatives we'd always stop in Bakersfield.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_151.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_151.txt,and then that -- towards the end of -- this is the beginning of southern California so part of it is from experience and family stuff. The other part is that I see the map as this valley and this valley so and we got the water and darn it they keep getting it from us.,19.347
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_152.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_152.txt,that's it's silly that California's one state. We're so different. I've always thought that there should've been a northern California and a southern California and this is where I would've broken it.,9.788
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_153.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_153.txt,It would've been better politically for everybody.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_154.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_154.txt,but two states I think a long time ago would've been very smart and it certainly would've been a good idea for northern California and their water interests.,6.739
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_25_part_155.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_25_part_155.txt,but uh yeah it's always been -- there's never been a doubt in my mind that that's the beginning  at least this far south is the beginning. It could ever be a little farther but,9.554

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_26_part_114.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_26_part_114.txt,so they go out so the forester has to go out and every couple hundred yards he has to hoot and uh you just go hoot hoot hoot and and then if you d- you know hoot back then you have to note it you have to do it at night,15.269
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_26_part_115.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_26_part_115.txt,no I'm not a forester but the foresters had to do that but the surveying industry sea was huge because every time they were logging they had to do the property lines and we had to build roads into where we were logging so it was a great job and then that was from seventy one to seventy five  and I did that ,20.459
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_26_part_116.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_26_part_116.txt,and it started we have national timber sales that the for- US Forest Service used to block out land and say okay you buy this [inaudible] they used to have t- timber companies buy this section and log it and and uh so those started slowing down,21.082
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_26_part_117.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_26_part_117.txt, and then um it just  we had a huge paper mill here  that was uh employed eight hundred people  and when the logging went away the the by-product of a sawmill is chips  or bad logs so those bad logs went to the paper mill,20.836
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_26_part_118.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_26_part_118.txt,you can make paper the other by-product is uh cogenerators that burn the really wei- the really stuff that's not good for anything in the bark and the smaller chips and the sawdust and all of that so those those this uh I was a pipefitter those were huge jobs for pipefitters,20.75

It's something psychologically because you don't see symmetry a lot in nature so the human mind isn't used to seeing it so even if it's something as inoccuous as two people sitting in a car having a conversation the fact that everything's perfectly lined up makes you -- makes your mind kind of unnerved. Like you're not -- there's something feels kind of off about it.,20.109

Um  it's pretty much all we did that's the only vacations we had was camping {LG} and then I didn't do it as much when I was married and had kids. My husband at the time didn't like it. I would do it on occasion on my own with kids or with friends um,23.746
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_33_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_33_part_36.txt, and then after I got divorced which is maybe six years ago I started doing it again with some friends of mind hiking  and um my boyfriend no who I've been with for three years he's really into it,20.057
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_33_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_33_part_37.txt,and um so I've gotten even more into it and into the backpacking which we go out for a few days.,7.476

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_33_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_33_part_40.txt,and now almost everybody I work with is Asian or I worked with a Turkish guy and I think there's what ten eleven people on my team I think there's only two um Caucasian people The diversity has definitely changed which is good.,18.694
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_33_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_33_part_41.txt,Probably segregated. I mean like where my kids went to school there wasn't -- which is right here in Fair Oaks uh not much diversity  which I probably don't get out enough to really see it but  I think it's probably pretty segregated at least in more --,22.329
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_33_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_33_part_42.txt,probably more based on income so the higher  income areas are more segregated I think. That's m- +more I think I've I don't know if that's just a feeling or I've read it in the paper and seen the little diagrams or something.,20.731
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_33_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_33_part_43.txt,I don't notice it but it may be that I'm not around it and my kids weren't around it. I'm sure it's probably there in some areas but I don't -- I don't see it.,13.201
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_33_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_33_part_44.txt,I think so again there's probably certain areas you wouldn't go in or go at night or something but I feel safe.,6.59
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_33_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_33_part_45.txt,Um I'm sure like Meadowview or certain neighborhoods have sort of a bad reputation. Del Paso Heights or Meadowview or even  um even around like Arden Fair at night you're little more careful,22.557
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_33_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_33_part_46.txt, so probably mostly at night.  South Sac just different areas like that yeah.,8.455
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_33_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_33_part_47.txt,Yeah I think so.  Again that may depend on where exactly you live but from my experience and my children's experience I think yes but again that may depend where you are and your income level and  but yeah.,18.158

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_16.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_16.txt,Apparently state of the art.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_20.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_20.txt,staff writer and then they invited me back this semester as one of the news editors oro as the news editor and so I just really -- and you know I haven't done any of this stuff since college you know and so uh but I do think that my management experience at the bank has been beneficial in,20.025
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_21.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_21.txt,organization and actually being succesfful in the role this tim eyou know and so um the photography is a brand new program though.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_22.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_22.txt,and um you know they -- they invited me to apply I guess is really basically what it boiled down to and I hadn't planned on coming back this semester to take any journalism classes. I was really gonna focus on uh just creative writing cuz that's something that I never really studied formally and I would like to. I just -- I might be fun to take a poe- +poetry poetry class and a creative writing class or a fiction class,22.891
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_23.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_23.txt,um but Jan was pretty convincing and -- and I -- and I like the group. It's just a fun group of people to be with and so They're uh nurturing and caring and um they like instruct you know it's not a negative environment to be in.,20.763
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_24.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_24.txt,and so this semester it turns out -- last semester it wasn't as significant because we had one like ten staff writers and uh this semester we only have four. We have the online side. There's the online publication also or the online news uh,21.522
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_25.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_25.txt,express online uh that we've got quite a few writers for that one and so that's you know prob- +probably I mean it makes. That's where people are headed these days but it's uh a little bit difficult to get good stories -- get good quality stories when the news editor is writing all of the news stories and so far I have three or four to write by next Friday,23.894
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_26.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_26.txt,um which means I've gotta get the interviews and all of that so I've -- I have to figure out how to motivate the people to take on new stories cuz it's not like -- it -- it's just not what they wanna do.,12.218
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_27.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_27.txt,so there -- there's no -- we do like little lectures. They'll do lectures on a Wednesday or something for the staff writers who may not be out at interviews uh and the editors wanna be there too so that they can reinforce and support it but this is basically the -- you know if I -- if I said hey I can't be in class cuz I've gotta go do an interview it'd be fine or even if I said hey I can't be in class because I have a sick kid,23.448
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_28.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_28.txt,you know it -- I'd -- I'm treating it and most of uh and the approach that I'm understanding from the advisors is this is a job and if you're not gonna be where we expect you to be you need to at least let us know.

data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_29.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_29.txt,I'm like dang it I can't motivate these people like I could when I worked at the bank. I could you know threaten to write people up if I had to.,9.74
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_30.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_30.txt,Yeah they -- they are. The -- the only downside really is that there's not enough of them to get all the stories written but um everybody that I've worked with so far as the news editor has been right on. They -- they're trying -- they're learning and -- no yeah I'm uh being facetious when I say they don't -- I can't motivate them with firing them. That was --,22.371
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_31.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_31.txt,that I talked to my ad- +advisor to Jan about. I'm like how do we motivate these guys? Grade isn't enough and you know what? Sometimes you don't.,7.193
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_32.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_32.txt,Yeah they should be um taking the class but we don't make it a hard rule because we run the risk of not having them available to write on the paper if they have to have taken certain prerequisites so basically what our folks -- what Jan and Rachel and them {LG},20.053
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_33.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_33.txt,say is if you can put a sentence together {LG} mostly grammatically correct we can work with you. {LG} So it's -- it really is uh we take what we can get and um and the one girl did come into the class who said she was a very low writing English level um when it came to the testing,23.652
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_34.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_34.txt,and so you know we offered to keep her there and you know there's -- there's so many other thingst hat can be done you know bullet points side bars -- there's so many things that um people who don't have strong writing skills can do and work on and still be a part of it and still make it successful but she wasn't interestd in that,20.687
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_35.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_35.txt,um but we do -- I -- I mean they -- that -- that department is so good about making people comfortable and successful. That's the goal of the department and uh it's just really impressive to me which is why I'm still there you know? It's -- if it had been a not um just supportive environment,20.944
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_36.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_36.txt,their paper but also this semester they -- we started the Main Line Magazine again and I'm in that class and so it's a literary magazine or not a literary magazine but it's a student published magazine. No advertisements and it's al student articles pictures ummostly campus based right?,21.298
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_37.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_37.txt,Um that magazine has won awards. In fact when it was done in ni- +nineteen in two thousand thirteen I wo- +won it won a couple of awards so that's it -- it really is just a phenomenal um pogram and to have advisors who really support it and wanna see the students do well. It's uh -- it's a pretty -- I -- I just kinda fell into Sac City College. I'm do I H S S for a guy who lives around the corner here,27.308
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_38.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_38.txt,and thought well why don't I take some classes? You know I have extra time in my schedule uh {LG} why don't I take some journalism classes and refresh and,11.057
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_39.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_39.txt,I want it to -- I you know it's wide open. Y- +you my main -- my main priority is you know Ferris and Dara making sure that they have everything that they need uh and Ferris only being you know she'll start going to preschool in the next year or so uh and so that'll free me up a little bit,21.075
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_40.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_40.txt,um from some of those morings. That's my main priority but I um love to copy edit. I know that sounds really strange but I really {LG} love to copy edit um one of favorite things to do is read something that somebody else has written and edit it. It -- it is much less work for me,20.955
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_41.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_41.txt,to edit something somebody else has writtent han for me to come p with what I need to write right? Uh so that's one of the reasons I really en- +enjoy I like being an editor because it's faster paced for me because I edit much quicker than I write but um um I love to copy edit and I figure that's probably something I can do uh in between,20.967
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_42.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_42.txt,actiities and events and I thought that's um I just need to get through a couple more semesters where I can get -- I can probably get Jan to write me a letter of reference or recommendation but I need to get some examples of my work so that I can uh -- cuz I -- I -- that's like I said one of my favorite things to do,23.191
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_43.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_43.txt,Give me something that somebody's written and I'll organize it and put it where so that it's easy to understand um but I do enjoy writing too but my favorite kind of writing is features.,14.446
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_44.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_44.txt,No just I -- I like to uh find those -- those folks or those programs or organizations that are unique to uh the area that I'm writing or that I'm in and share different pe- +perspectives perspectives and lifestyles and cuz I think we get too stuck in the mainstream. We get -- you know get stuck to what we think should be out there based on what we seeon T V and,25.455
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_45.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_45.txt,Uh I thin kmy favorite piece. I gotta find it. I'm not sure where it is but my favorite piece was when I was in -- I was still in college and I did a literary journalism piece on {CG} a lady that lived next door to me in the building that I lived in and I could hear everything that she said because the walls in the apartment building were paper thin. This was my last semester in college. It was like a three,23.545
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_46.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_46.txt,hundred fifty dollar a month one bedroom apartment and so you take what you can get right? And so I could hear everything she said and the first couple of weeks I was stressed as can be cuz I wasn't getting any sleep because she's -- she talked in her sleep all night long. She -- I mean it -- sweetest lady but she didn't have visitors coming -- she was an older woman didn't have visitors -- I don't even know that she um,23.786
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_47.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_47.txt,had -- she didn't access any social services that were available to her. I mean it was she was just a lonely woman and she sat on her porch a lot so I wrote a lit- +literary and it tied in nicely with my gerontology minor wrote apiece about uh -- and using her as my focus um for my subject but the services available to people who are aging you know and,24.721
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_48.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_48.txt,what she was going through individually in her life cuz uh the visitors that she did have were her sons that were not nice to her and yeah it was just so it was a -- that I think um was a very eye opening experience for me not ever really having been exposed to somebody who was in that much need,20.191
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_49.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_49.txt,but family that just wouldn't support or help. I -- that was so foreign to me that -- that she wouldn't have the help that she needs and {CG} her nighttime rants were sad because they were always directed at her kids,14.762
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_50.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_50.txt,yeah cuz there -- I mean there was nobody there. I think she was dreaming cuz just the way the -- the -- I -- you can kinda tell I think if there's a coherency around it or not and it sounded to me like she was sleeping and um so every chance I got we'd sit out on the porch and chat and talk and that was -- and I knew,22.122
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_51.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_51.txt,at the beginning of the semester that was gonna be my project for my literary journalism piece and it worked out really well. I mean I ended up with an A on the -- with an A on the project. If I had been thinking through it I might've had it published you know but I guess at that age you really,15.298
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_52.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_52.txt,Yeah {LG} so I have no idea. Um and something that actually I do. I have an idea from um just the last couple of semesters working with Jan but prior to that no idea and yeah uh basically pitching it sending a query letter out saying I'd like to write this and uh wondering if it's something you'd be interested in purchasing.,22.712
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_53.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_53.txt,More often than not you know if they respond in the positive yeah we'd like -- we would be interested in purchasing it it's write it and then we'll talk,7.6
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_54.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_54.txt,so trying to get um that commitment that yes we will purchase it is pretty difficult until -- probably until they get to know your writing and that sort of thing so that's what I haven't really started doing yet is um putting it out there outside of school. One because I just don't have the time now if I'm writing four articles next week when would I do it right?,21.379
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_55.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_55.txt,Um but two because we're still trying to balance at home and you know I've got uh Ferris at home and uh Dar is at school online. They're doing online high schools. They're home too and um,17.37
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_56.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_56.txt,Yeah it's a online -- um it's online high school um powered by the -- the curriculum comes from K twelve. It's a organization that writes curriculum I guess. It's commonly known. I didn't know 'em but they -- they do the -- support the curriculum but it's all free. Now you can buy extra K twelve curriculum for like the preschoolers and that sort of,23.79
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_57.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_57.txt,um but I -- I don't. There's plenty of preschool activities for free online. I just don't see myself paying for a worksheet that has a big A on it um {LG} when I -- I could draw that myself uh but the online high school it is so cool.,21.474
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_58.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_58.txt,the -- they meet once -- they have to meet once a week in their homeroom right and so they had the homeroom teacher where the log in and they actuallydo live call homeroomy stuff which I guess would be pretty common with any other high school um so they have to do that once a week but the curriculum is math English uh,22.373
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_59.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_59.txt,French and whatever -- all the other curriculums but um it's self paced uh a lot of it you know once the -- the homeroom teacher was saying that a lotta teachers once you show profiency in one unit they'll open up the next unit for you to move forward so that you can get through the curriuclum um the -- the only downside to online high school versus the elementary schools,27.349
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_60.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_60.txt,is that they're required to spend a certain amount of time each day in the subject which makes it difficult if you don't need that amount of time each day in the subject and so we're still figuring out how to work around that cu I figure you know what if we're turning all our stuff in and we're getting it all right then obviously you've learned it so you get your hour,25.597
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_61.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_61.txt,{LG} you know? So it's uh really really a neat program. They -- we -- they did a meet and greet last week -- this week on Tuesday for the first day they went and met their home room teacher so uh I didn't go to that one cuz I had an interview on campus but um dad went and so that was -- they said it was fun,22.808
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_62.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_62.txt,it's a -- it's avail- +available it's available to anybody in the region right so it doesn't -- it's not all over California where ours is Sutter -- we're tied to the Sutter group um but not all California counties are eligible but really we saw it on the T V and on the commercials and uh so we called and I asked,22.172
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_63.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_63.txt,about it and we did qualify from our region where we were and uh basically it was uh in an effort to support being able to focus our attention while in high school on th eacademics and not be worrieda bout you know the uh situations around us and um the -- the nonsense if you will of teachers having to babysit,25.099
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_64.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_64.txt,the -- and just the distractions involved with that and and so we're be- +being we're seeing a much better focus and uh then with social opportunities outsid eof that you know our philosophy really was well if we're gonna develop our social skills and that's what we're focusing on then let's have some social events that matter to us,24.637
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_65.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_65.txt,and that we want to attend and we wanna go to and -- and high school wasn't that. {LG} Yes I know I loved school. I -- but I never went to class either. I got straight A's but I never went to class. I just -- I'd go in do what I needed to do and then say hey I'm gonna go uh to the journalism lab,22.246
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_66.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_66.txt,or I'm gonna go to the library or I'm gonna do this and uh I never got any push back from teachers cuz I always had my work done but um it's an entirely different world than it was when I was in school and schools are a lot more hard pressed to make sure they know where their kids are and they know where the kids are so having them flitting about around campus I guess is less of an option than it was when I was young.,26.396
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_67.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_67.txt,Uh so far we just started this week. So far so good. I mean no no in fact uh three days okay this would be day four this week so three days this week I was gone for um the onboarding classes and uh I do have to do attendance so I've gotta make sure that we did do work in each class -- that,24.588
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_68.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_68.txt,so far it's just been conversations. You know I'm not -- it -- it -- the concern is nowhere uh as far as getting the work done. I know that's gonna get done and it's gonna get turned in. That's beside the point. The issues um that we were having had nothing to do with the with the actual schoolwork so,20.896
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_69.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_69.txt,um so far so far no. It's just a conversation just a quick conversation that says hey did you log into here? Did you log into there? Did you do that? Did you see your K mail from your teacher? And,12.561
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_70.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_70.txt,Yeah I -- the -- the toddler as she is affectionately known uh I have the feeling she's gonna nee dpeople and school and I'm gonna need her to need people and school. She -- that child is crazy. Wouldn't trade her for the world but she's nuts. She's a crazy baby,21.939
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_71.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_71.txt,and she really likes people. She really likes to be out and about. She loves going -- going away you know she loves to get in the car and go somewhere. I'm going out. She loves the grocery store so she's gonna -- I -- I'm gonna have a hard time keeping her home probably but um,20.146
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_72.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_72.txt,to each their own you know? They'll both do what they need to do to be successful and happy which is my main concern,8.223
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_73.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_73.txt,It's not -- it's not the same place I grew up. Um well it is the same place I grew up but uh my kids have much different experiences in Sacramento than I had. I was uh involved in the community when I was little. I -- my parents worked for uh City of Sacramento. Actually my dad still works for the City of Sacramento,22.104
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_74.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_74.txt,um with the disabled services access leader program so a lotta my time from age seven on was spent volunteering at these events with people with disabilities. Um I worked on the great race. I don't know if you're familiar with it (()) great race but,15.422
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_75.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_75.txt,I worked on that from age ten on. I volunteered and then I was on the committee. Both my parents were committee members . Um I did -- I was very involved in high school. I was associated student body. You know I was and familiar with uh the environment and the area and comfortable in it but uh,20.929
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_76.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_76.txt,Dar and Ferris have both had just very different experiences cuz you know I had a nine to five -- seven A M to {LG} eight or nine P M job sometimes and so we haven't spent as much time in the community as I grew up doing and I miss it. I really do. In fact,21.112
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_77.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_77.txt,uh my husband and I were talking about what we can do to be stronger supporters of like his school area cuz like his -- he teaches and so he teachesa t Valley High School and we're trying to come up with ideas on what we can do um to help that area and -- and those neighborhoods because they're sorely lacking in resources and,21.726
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_78.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_78.txt,opportunities and it's a -- just a very depressing area because they don't have the same resources that their counterparts in wealthier parts of the district have and it's -- it's very frustrating and that's the area I grew up in. He teaches at the high school that I went to freshman year in and then when they built a new high school in the area I actually moved to that high school my sophomore year,24.551
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_79.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_79.txt,um and actually was part of the first graduating class which was a very significant uh event for the community so that was just even a stronger tie to uh being in Sacramento for that long that I even saw you know and was a part of that high school opening and being a part of that so that was fun.,20.902
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_80.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_80.txt,He -- no he was actually born in southern California somewhere. Laguna something or other uh and then went -- he lived in Fresno. He lived in San Diego um he lived in quite a few -- Fresno and San Diego for sure. Porterville -- he lived in Porterville for a while uh Fresno area. Madero that's kinda where he grew up and then he moved to Sacramento I think probably when his mom did,28.244
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_81.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_81.txt,uh oh actually and he went to Consumnas River College uh the year I was a freshman at Valley and we didn't know it. We didn't know each other then. We didn't know each other until well fourteen years ago. Uh fifteen years ago so it uh kind of a small world. And that's what I think of Sacramento. It's a small town,22.26
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_82.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_82.txt,It's supposed to be the ca- +capitol I mean it's supposed to not be a small town but when you -- I mean having grown up here I can't go anywhere without seeing somebody that I know you know and so if y- +you and you can tell the Sacramento -- {LG} you can tell people have been here and so it really is amazing um to me that -- and if not me then if I'm with my mom,21.38
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_83.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_83.txt,she sees someone she knows right? Cuz she's lived here as long as I have at least and so we always see people we know and in fact my husband he used to get so frustrated when we went out when we first met because we'd always run into people that I knew. {LG} I ran into people from high school from college -- I mean,20.184
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_84.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_84.txt,when you do everything your entire life in the same city you're gonna run into you know that and so he's used to it now,9.473
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_85.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_85.txt,No um I do now no- +now I'm like gosh you know part of it i- +is part of it was anxiety. I mean um turns out that I don't travel well. And uh realized that seven years ago I mean just brand new. I -- I just always thought I loved Sacramento so much I couldn't live anywhere else,20.959
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_86.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_86.txt,but seven years ago we went on a um -- on a trip. We went to uh Ireland and the just the traveling being away from home bein gaway from what was familiar complete meltdown. That just did not wrok out for me at all. Uh I've since worked through how to travel without um,22.93
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_87.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_87.txt,losing it but that was very eye opening experience for me cuz I had planned to go Chico State. That was my original hope was to go to Chico State because the journalism department at the time at Chico was uh just one of the best in the state and I -- I wanted -- that's where I wanted to go but I chickened out. I couldn't -- you know I couldn't leave home.,22.053
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_88.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_88.txt,In fact that house that I have I bought is the house that I grew up in. I bought it from my mom and so uh my family is growing up in the same house that I grew up in. Of course uh my family doesn't -- my children don't go to school,20.188
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_89.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_89.txt,in that area because it's uh -- it's just the opportunities just aren't as available to them there as they are at other schools you know and it's really frustrating. I wish they were cuz I l- +love I love,14.013
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_90.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_90.txt,Yeah Floren -- Floren area. It's uh Floren Road Power Inn um and I mean just it's my stomping grounds. It's where I grew up and I -- it's not a creepy place to be. It's not a scary place to be but I have friends who won't come visit at night sorta thing and it's like you guys oh my go- +gosh,21.356
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_91.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_91.txt,uh viewed as lower income um very diverse. It's a very diverse uh part of Sacramento and it uh lends itself to ju- +just I mean the food is so good out there. We have such good food places,20.326
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_92.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_92.txt,and it -- it just really makes me sad that you know people come and into the area from Roseville that you know it's like there's absolutely nothing scary about my neighborhood alright? {LG} And part of it is we live on a court and it's the court that I grew up on so there are quite a few families on the court that I grew up with,23.888
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_93.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_93.txt,and so you know we've got two people on these corners that um both the kids grew up (()) you know they -- they've been around for us as long as we've been in the house uh you know then down the street they're -- I mean just lots ofpeople that we're familiar with and we wave and I you know wouldn't trade it for the world. It's a nice little court,21.674
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_94.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_94.txt,but there still is that fear that drives me crazy. It just makes me very sad and but we're not as bad as the (()) area. Um my husband's mom lives over in the south area also and but they do a lotta fun stuff. They -- they just started doing city night lights,20.868
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_95.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_95.txt,{LG} and um it just brings the community together. I had hoped to go out last weekend so that I could write a story on it and see if I could sell it to someone but I just didn't make it.,11.361
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_96.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_96.txt,Del Paso Heights maybe? But even then no no there isn't. I might uh be a little more aware of my surroundings but there are very few pl- +places you know quite honestly I'm more apprehensive about walking from a class to my car on campus,21.227
data_processed_voc/wav/voc_35_part_97.wav,data_processed_voc/txt_raw/voc_35_part_97.txt,than I am walking down the street in my neighborhood at night or even any of the neighborhoods at night I'm not worried,7.245
